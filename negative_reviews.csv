The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through. 
 
I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",1551840071,1551840071,False,826,46,0.939142584800720215,31,True,False,False

Being something relatively new in the multiplayer scene (THAT ACTUALLY HAD A MASSIVE PLAYER-BASE), I managed to talk few of my friends into playing it.

I'm not going to lie, we've spent hundreds of hours on it.

That was until the official release of 1.0
Keep in mind that we're talking about previously most played game in the world at some point, a game which brought it's developers millions (if not 10 digit numbers), and as any sane person, you'd expect that it will be poured into further development and fixes, right?

LOL wrong. We're talking about Bluehole here.

You really have to be next level special in order to stumble upon a gold mine, and then proceed to blow it up and cave it in. They had everything, massive FREE ADVERTISEMENT (NOTE: FREE > NOT REQUIRED TO PAY FOR) in a form of Twitch streamers and YouTube content creators, insane ACTIVE player-base, a product that's close to being 1.0 ready... Everything.
They got money, they got everything. And what do they do?:
 
In game purchases.

It's disgusting seeing that someone who had all the foundation required to make a masterpiece ignore all that and just attempts to drain more money from players.
They rushed the 1.0 to be able to implement in-game purchases, and instead of actually WORKING on it, what do they do? More platforms.
Not only that none of the platforms performed remotely well, they completely ignored that fact and started working on more crates and more in-game purchases.

Since I could go about this all day long, and considering I'm actually rating a game here and not it's thirsty developer, I'll focus on it now:

Pros:
- Fast queue times due to high player-base,
- SOLID graphics.
- Good ballistics (Sniper and AR bullet drop)


Cons:
- Fully released game some of the problems that should have been fixed before the release.

EDIT:
- PLENTY OF CHEATERS. Even though the developers started to take action against hackers now that the game has headed to ruin, there are still PLENTY of non-conventional cheaters such as VPN abusers (lifting ping on purpose to abuse the poor netcode and hit detection) and Macro users (Auto-aim/Recoil control). Even though the numbers have dropped, this is still heavily affecting the game and user experience.

- Countless game breaking bugs (getting killed by nothing when vaulting, getting stuck in thin air while landing resulting in getting killed, reloading sometimes doesn't reload your weapon at all resulting in getting killed...)

- HORRIBLE performance issues (High end PC users can be happy if they hit constant 60fps on medium-high settings at all times)

- Hilarous netcode. So many instances when you get killed by someone who didn't even have a line of sight, constant stuttering, 60%+ fail rate of reconnecting to the game in case of a disconnect.

- Horrible bullet detection system (this one mostly affects Shotguns)

- Retarded level design. This one is a great issue mostly focused on the Miramar map. They forced a new map which is massive in terms of size, but ironically has least content, least quality looting area, a MASSIVE LACK of vehicles considering the proportions of the map (mostly resulting in you playing a running simulator for about 20 minutes and ending up getting killed by someone who had luck with the initial safe zone). Even though the original map is better, they still need to prevent bridge camping which makes the game impossible if you had bad luck with initial looting and safe zone.

- EDIT: Since one of the recent patches, my character no longer stutters while running, proving my point this was indeed caused by the game, and not by my PC or internet connection.

- I will stop with Cons for now since there's only so much time I can waste on this review. But yes, there are way more.

Bottom line, if you haven't already bought this game: DO NOT. Save your money. There are better alternatives if you're just taking up a new game, and they're even free to play. They don't have some of the mechanics PUBG has, and that's a shame, but at least they're optimized. Keep in mind that this game requires over the average PC to even be able to start the game, let alone play it properly.

One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.

I've been playing for well over a year, only not as frequently lately, and it is because of my last few months of experience with this game that I can no longer recommend it to people.

This game started off great. There was so much promise in its concept and execution. You could almost feel what the game should eventually be even waaaay back in its early state, back when it was so broken that a stun grenade in a busy portion of the map like School would spell disaster for several teams by promptly crashing their games with no capability to return to the match. And yet, even with absolutely infuriating scenarios like that, I am finding myself looking more fondly upon those memories than I do towards the game in its current state. And it's not from lack of improvement. Such game breaking bugs like that have been removed, and the core gameplay is leaps and bounds more smooth, intuitive, and reliable. However, there are still massive faults.

I am an average player. I have won many, many chickens between solo, duos, 2-man, 3-man, and full squad. But I died/lost 4/5 games I played, a figure which has increased dramatically as of late. I haven't won a game in weeks, nay, quite possibly over a month. And it hasn't been from lack of trying, and certainly not from good teammates. Is it balance changes? It can't be. SMG's, DMR's, and the AK currently reign supreme, my favorite and most used weapons in the game. They shoot better, tighter, and more naturally. Aiming feels great. The new attachments and scopes are great. All of the map changes are great. Every improvement they have made has been great.

So what is it? What is my problem with this game?

As of 6 months ago, this game was a cesspool of Chinese cheaters, leaving most matches in a state of absolute chaos and dismay as you get to the final several people alive only to be instantly headshotted by some cuck with an aimbot that couldn't possibly have had a bead on you from 150m out with an (at the time) incredibly underpowered Vector. And while the volume of this has subsided, [i]it still fucking happens[/i]. What's worse is that it is no longer just foreign influence to blame. There are plenty of English speaking cheaters as well. And what makes matters worse is that the death cam and spectator views in the game are so broken that in many instances it's hard to tell if someone [i]isn't[/i] cheating because more often than not, the perspective you end up seeing shows wild shots into the distance, inhuman camera snaps, and impossibly compensated recoil that leave you itching to hit that report button. Are people really this good? Was 6 months all it took for people to get [i]really, really[/i] good at this game even after it had already sold 20+ million copies? I often tend to think not, and as such, any and all suspicious deaths now get a gracious report regardless of what I see in the death cam. And honestly, [i]that's not fucking cool[/i].

But to blame cheaters for all of this games shortcomings isn't fair, because that isn't every game. Sometimes you do just get outplayed or royally screwed by RNG or core gameplay mechanics. And I think that's where the true fault is in this game. Now that a lot of bugs have been removed and the core gameplay has been overall tightened, it's beginning to show that the base game is just...not that good. Yes, weapons are balanced, movement and interaction are much better than they used to be (though sometimes still infuriatingly clunky and unresponsive at the beginning of the game), but to call the game itself balanced is rubbish. Either you get lucky and nobody drops near you, giving you a chance to actually find gear, or you don't and you die instantly, leaving your team at a disadvantage and more often than not resulting in an immediate return to the lobby as no single member of the party wants to spectate for the next 20 minutes. This simple aspect of the game is both rewarding when you make it through, and anger inducing when you don't, cursing RNGesus to hell as you slam your left mouse button with so much hatred over that ""Exit to Lobby"" UI element.

But that is only one source of frustration. The other is how the game handles characters being behind cover. This is I think the most important complaint any player could make about this game. I have in the several hundred gigs of replays and game captures so many instances of deaths where I am shot by someone hiding behind a tree or rock or building, where only the teeniest, tiniest part of their head is exposed from the cover, yet somehow according to the game mechanics, their gun is also able to fire around that cover and complete a shot. Yet it seems when I try to do this same action, I feel completely exposed. No matter how much I lean into and creep around a corner, it's as though my entire body is exposed, and I am more often than not targeted and shot within milliseconds of bringing my gun up to aim and tapping the peek controls. For a game that while obviously isn't rooted purely in realism but still tries its hardest to bring a sense of reality into player interaction, instances like this absolutely confuse me.

Another current aggrivation includes hit detection and the application of armor values. I played a game a couple nights ago where a player in a ghillie suit was creeping his way into the circle while my squadmates and I began popping shots at him. I hit him 3 solid times with a Mini 14 from ~ 150m out. Blood on each shot, absolutely unmistakable hits right to center mass. Another teammate scored another 2 shots on him with a SCAR-L, and another teammate with an SKS delivered the killing blow with 2 well placed headshots. Upon making my way over to him, I noticed something incredibly strange. His body contained a fresh, untouched and undamaged level 3 helmet, as well as a level 3 vest that still had a whopping 173 armor value left on it. We even compared game replay footage afterwards to confirm our blood splatters, all of which according to our games showed a total of 7 confirmed hits with fully outfitted, high damage weapons. How is this possible? What about the headshots that killed him, that actually confirmed in the kill feed that he was killed with a HEADSHOT? How does this translate to no damage being taken to the level 3 helmet?

This is not the first instance of this I have seen either. Since the latest balance changes, body armor appears to have become...broken. At times, you'll feel as though your level 3 vest does absolutely nothing when you get hit in the chest from 300m away with an M24 and your vest is destroyed in a single hit. And yet other times you'll find yourself hitting someone repeatedly with a similar sniper/DMR, only to see that shiny glint of a green level 1 helmet or the washed out blue of the level 1 police vest still intact and on their body.

I'd like to believe I'm just crazy. I'd like to believe I just suck. But then I play a game or two where things just work out and I wipe a team, maybe even two by myself. And while I would love for those moments to redeem this game, to make me go ""Wow that was so worth the pain and anguish of the last 11 games filled with absolute bullshit"", it isn't. Not anymore. Because even those games were you find yourself wiping squad after squad, you still get to the final couple circles only to be met with a fate that often feels engineered to put you at odds with someone who just happened to get lucky in one way or another. It is this inconsistency that makes this game feel like a waste of time.

Winning is no longer a reward of skill, it's a byproduct of luck and inconsistent game mechanics. More often than not, you'll find yourself feeling like you've simply wasted your time playing this.

Winning your first match is a feeling that few things can compare too. But I'm going to tell you now, once the honeymoon phase wears off, this game QUICKLY stops being fun and you'll begin to notice just how awful the quality of it is.

- The netcode in this game is absolutely atrocious, and is hugely abusable for players with a high ping. The extremely low tickrate and insane desync that results from it means that you're constantly dying around corners a full second after taking cover - or worse, dumping half a magazine of full-auto assault rifle into someone as soon as they come around a corner, only to get onetapped by them mid-spray because they'd already come around the corner and shot you dead on their end two seconds ago, before you even saw them start moving on your end. No ping cap or region lock means players can queue for matches on servers halfway across the world and instantly get an insane amount of peeker's advantage.

- There's a huge cheater population in the game that has been there ever since PUBG started getting popular. Aimbot, wallhacks, recoil scripts, teaming in solo matches, the list goes on. Battleeye does next to nothing to stop this.

- There are still bugs galore that need to be fixed, some of which have been in the game since alpha. Randomly dying from fall damage just because you brushed up against the wrong wall/object, vehicles glitching into walls or flying into the stratosphere from the slightest collision (admittedly hilarious but still in need of fixing), hit registration being complete garbage - there's just too many to list here. 

But in their infinite wisdom, Bluehole decided to let all this go through to the 1.0 release instead of actually making the game a release-ready product, likely for Christmas sales.

------------------------------------------
As a life-long gamer I have learned there are two ingredients that, when applied, spell out destruction. Greed and disregarding your fanbase's concerns yields a drop in customers as well as reputation. I will write an honest, unbiased review based off of my gameplay experience and thank you for taking the time to read my review. 

*For the sake of the review I will include the whole entity of PUBG (head company/developers/publishers) when I mention ""PUBG""*

Going back a few years, I spent a good amount of time in DAYZ:SA. I really enjoyed the loot/survival aspect, but the game was being developed far too slowly and I was ready to move on. I hopped on the Battlegrounds train while it was in the beta stage and I was impressed. In the midst of a growing market of battle royale games I decided to give my time and money to PUBG because I anticipated a lot of great content. Normally I pray the rosary at the thought of ""early access"" games and throw holy water on pre-orders, but after reading several great reviews I wanted to see what the hype was about. From conception to release, the game seemed to grow exponentially and everything was going great. They even had 2 crates, Suvivor and Wanderer, that you didn't need a case key to open. Was this CD PROJEKT RED manifesting in a different form? Everything was going well until the introduction of paid crates. 

The core things I like about PUBG at this moment in time are:
*Diversity of weapons
*Diversity of attachments
*Character agility (vaulting/jumping/crouching/prone/swimming)
*Vehicular maneuverability
*Vehicular diversity
*Access to every building, making it feel immersive

The core things I dislike about PUBG at this moment in time are:
*Clientside lag
*High ping players being grouped with low/moderate ping players
*Paid Crates/skins
*Bluehole trying to scrape as much money before the game capsizes
*Useless weapons (crowbar/machete)

To me, this game feels like a cash grab. Instead of fixing their netcode, separating players based off of ping, and developing a structured game, PUBG does the opposite. It caters to a younger audience that doesn't know any better about the prinicples of gambling, attempts defaming Fortnite instead of taking some ideas and implementing them in a better way, and bases the game off of an economy. Anything that is based off of economic gain, and content not in the interest of customers, on a fundamental level WILL collapse. Once the economy runs dry, so do the developers and the trend follows all the way through to the top, whereas the opposite will happen if you keep your customers happy. What's more upsetting is the ""FIX PUBG"" button in the menu on the top right once the game loads. It is up to the developers to create, patch, and improve a game while listening to the player. Instead I get the feeling that our concerns go in one ear and out the other while continuing to release new crates/skins/clothes.

Dean Hall promised so many fans a working DAYZ:SA, but once he reached his financial goal, he ran and left the DAYZ:SA corpse to rot in someone else's hands. History repeats itself.

Vote with your wallet. Do not support this game or any others that are more interested in your hard earned money than they are interested in giving you a fun, memorable experience.

At the time of this review being published, I have logged 275 hours into the game.",1534698197,1535670846,False,771,27,0.879711389541625977,45,True,False,False

First some PROS:
+ Still might have some potential...
+ Highly competitive -> no storytelling, just get in the action (for those who want this kind of games).
+ Thrilling -> reaching the finale is a quite an adrenaline boost, you have to focus in, stay sharp and vigilent.
+ Quite difficult -> weapon mechanics for example: bullet drop, recoil, weapon attachments, bullet travel speed, damage etc. have to be considered and make the game harder to master thus more interesting and rewarding.

Now let's get to the points which make all the PROS above irrelevant. The developers managed to turn this game into absolute garbage: 

- Doesn't matter what kind of PC you have: Crashes, Stutters, FPS Drops 24/7
- Doesn't matter how fast your internet is: Their servers don't give a damn
- Doesn't matter how good of a player you are: You die to game bugs, lags, freezes, crashes, desync ent.
- Doesn't matter if developers see these comments: You get crates with fancy clothes to dress your character and patches that continue to ruin the gameplay and performance.
- Doesn't matter that new maps are released: All of them are unplayable due to the horrible server performance/netcode
- Doesn't matter if you actually want to play: ""Servers are too busy. Please try again later.""

A few examples:
* You land with a large group o people around that try to defeat you, you find a weapon, you can not pick up the weapon because the game lags out HARD (no matter the internet connection), you die to someone who had ""server luck"" on their side and actually picked up a weapon.
* You try to remain stealthy and silent so people don't spot you, you die because someone followed you by seeing your bugged out weapon models randomly hanging in the air on the path you took before.
* You get shot at, you see who it is and hide behind a big ass rock. You are perfectly hidden, the guy doesn't see you and shoots at the air near the rock, you die because these shots hit you. (Confirmed with death-cam)
* You run into a guy, blast a shotgun right into his chest/face at close range, (blood shows confirming you hit him) but somehow he's perfectly fine, shoots you and kills you, you check the death cam - his HP remained full all the time.

All examples above do not occur rarely, but daily and theres much more. Welcome to PUBG.

You didnt stop as just desperado crates which are pulled 1 out of 3 times, but now i do 4 pulls and get 4 different crates that all require keys. Fever, Desperado, Equinox, Triumph. As you serious with this shit. This has to stop and i will not support this business model.

This game had/has a lot of potential. When it started off the mechanics, and game play design were quite fun and intriguing. However, over the last 6 months, they have taken what promised to be a fun very challenging game, and basically buried it under a pile of money. 

What do I mean by that? Well let me explain. They have taken a fun game that millions of people have spent their hard earned cash to purchase, and turned it into a game that caters to the cheaters, and hackers. The developers have turned a blind eye to those of us who want to play a fair game. In order to play this game we ALL had to drop a few bucks for the original purchase price which I believe is $29.99. Multiply that my 3-5 million sold, and we have made this company very, very wealthy. 

Now as with any popular game, the cheaters, and hackers went right to work developing ways to get the advantage over those of us who use actual skill to play. Once they developed numerous cheats, and hacks, they started selling those to the not so honest gamer. Those gamer's then flood the game with their not so covert hacks, and they run around the map using either speed hacks, wall hacks or the most popular no recoil hack.

 In the beginning it was rare for me to be killed by one of these cheaters, as there were not to many of them. My first experience was with my crew of 4, all of whom are experienced high level 1st person shooter veterans like myself. We have been playing fps together for many years, and have been ranked top in the world on many platforms. That day we were near Severny on the original map, all 4 of us were headed to one of the bunkers just outside of town. Upon reaching the entrance one of my crew was dropped by a head shot from a 45 pistol. None of us had seen or heard anyone else near us. As he yelled into his mic for us to back him up, we all turned to head towards him, that's when we all saw our 1st blatant cheater. This person ran past us moving at the speed of a Dacia at full throttle, and as he buzzed a circle around us, he fired just 3 rounds from his 45, each round striking each of our team in the head. 

Needless to say none of us were to pleased to have spent the last 30 minutes of our time to get into the top ten left alive, only to have some unskilled looser rob us of a fun time. Now keep in mind we had all played for many hours at this point, and had only heard talk of cheaters, never had we experienced one, until then. 

Since that day, the number of cheaters have risen to a point that I can say with a strong belief, that every single round played now has 1 to 30 people per round using outside software to enhance there game, to a point that even highly skilled players cannot compete with. Why haven't the developers done anything about this you might ask. Well they have, they have done very little to be honest. 

They have banned a few million people for cheating already, but it is not a permanent ban, that person can create a new steam account, pay for the game again, and start over. But why would someone want to risk being banned, and then have to pay another $29.99 to get back in you might wonder. Well that's simple to explain as well. The company who created this game gets extra revenue, because they allow the once banned to repurchase another game, so they make more money that way. But its not the only way the company profits from these cheaters. The cheaters play as long as they can before they get banned, which is historically anywhere from a month to 3 months. 

During that time they rack up massive amounts of BP (in game fake money) that they then use to buy crates in the game. These crates contain skins for weapons, cloths, shoes, etc. Some crates you get, require a key to open them. The only way you can get a key is to purchase one from the company for real currency. Therefore making them even more profit. There is a real world demand for these items, and people sell them on the open marketplace for cash. Some items are worth over $1000 real world cash. So the longer the cheaters can stay in the game before they get banned, the more BP they acquire, and the more money they spend to buy keys. Then they turn around and sell the items they get on the marketplace, and make REAL money. Therefore the cheaters make more than enough to cover another game once they get banned, and the company gets richer. The only losers in this setup are the real gamer's, who mistakenly bought this game to challenge themselves, and to have fun. 

The Creators of this game have no intention of making it cheater, and hacker free, as that will lower the overall income they get. Lets face the facts,they wont get rich off of the not so honest players like they are now. Don't expect them to do anything more than they already are. They will make a big deal about how many people they banned in the last big sweep of catching cheaters, just like the last 6-7 times they have made this anouncment. But if you notice, and pay close attention, they only do that every few months. That way they give the cheaters time to profit so they can buy back in again before they run another ban sweep. Its all about the money to these people, not a single one gives a (*&^ about the real gamer's. 

The game used to be a blast, but now its a joke. I know that I, and many others will not waste our money on any games this company puts out in the future. They have proven themselves to be as worthless to the honest player as the hackers are. Don't waste your time, or money on this game.

I have had a hell of a lot of fun playing solo, with friends and with new friends. I am yet to find a game where i get the same adrenaline rush that I get when I play this game but honestly I really couldn't be bothered recommending/inviting anyone to play anymore.

Update #12 (April 2018) broke the OC servers. We had to play SEA or AS servers to be able to actually play a game. A group of 100+ Australian and New Zealand players grouped together (from discord) and tried to join a game at the same time and they just weren't able to. OC servers were fucked! Sure we had the smallest playbase but if you looked at the PUBG sub reddit, we were by far the most vocal. It took 5 months for them to implement a new matchmaking system and all that did was screw over the other regions (NA players being forced to play on EU/AS/SEA servers and vise versa, etc.).

It's been a long time since 1.0 has been released and there's still problems after problems. There really isn't any excuse for how many bugs/glitches/matchmaking problems there have been and how and why they're continuing!

I'm probably going to keep this game installed for another couple months incase friends invite me (but also to see if it actually improves (LOL)) but anyone thinking about buying this game or reinstalling it, i would honestly suggest you keep your money/bandwidth and play something else.

This game isn't made by a competent company. It was a quick cash grab that far exceeded their expectations and they just kept building on top of a broken model. It would have to built again from the ground up and be released as PUBG 2.0 but who would honestly spend any money on this company again?",1539104951,1539108381,False,141,7,0.845396339893341064,10,True,False,False

I've logged a ton of hours under my belt, and for the game play has been fun when everything works as planned. HOWEVER, there are tons of bugs. Recently, they decided to release a ""gift"" to their playerbase as an apology for all the bugginess that has been problematic. BUT, there was a bug, for their apology for their bugs. Funny right? To make everything worse, they decided to punish the playerbase for this new bug. Because they accidentally gave out an extra 20k BP (in game currency), they decided to just take it away from the people that received extra. Because I spent it on in game grates, I now have almost negative 20k BP.

This doesn't bother me too much, in terms of the in game repercussions of not being able to buy crates. But I think it really reflects how this game's company treats its playerbase. To use such a petty move, to punish the playerbase for their own mistakes, truly reflects how low they have stooped. 

The game is still buggy as ever, if not more. I constantly crash, whether at the lobby of the game, or loading in to a game. This makes it hard to play with my squad, because someone always crashes loading in, leading us all to have to back out. Assuming someone doesn't crash loading back in to the game, we would have to qeue up for another game hoping we don't crash in the process.

Anyways, those are just my thoughts. It feels as if the game is not making any forward progress, and new updates are centered around trying to make microtransactions more integrated. I would not recommend purchasing this game, moving forward.

The gameplay loop and idea is fun, the execution unfortunately is not and in its current state I can't recommend you get into it if you haven't already. Yeah the rush of an end game kill and chicken dinner is fun, and the gun battles (when they aren't bugging, glitching or full of hackers) can be pretty good, map design, graphics and sounds are all average to poor. 

Where it really starts to go bad is in the technical aspects. The game is an absolute mess, patches break things that were already fixed and version control appears to not exist, performance zig-zags up and down depending on dozens of unknown factors (time of day, is this a ""good"" or ""bad"" patch, are the servers trash today or somehow stable, are people lagging or desyncing all over for the first 5 minutes, the most important and dangerous part of the game until the end) even my brand new i7 8700k, GTX 1080, and 16 gb ram randomly has what appear to be framerate lag issues for no reason on a brand new fresh install of windows 10 on an SSD. Meanwhile the developers work to add the next loot box or skin, trying desperately to squeeze every last drop of blood they can before the playbase disappears due to rage/burnout from the endless issues or newer better battle royale games ecplipse and destroy PUBG.

Prepare to hit invisible stuff in your car and explode, spray down enemies and never do damage, hackers to blast your head off from 400 metres away when you peaked for a less than 0.1 seconds, watch in shock and awe as your character dies seconds after rounding a corner to safety as your lag ghost gets gunned down by an enemy who could see you for extra seconds due to desync. Enjoy fun games like loot loading in after you have already run through a room giving the guy who landed seconds AFTER you a free AK47 at point blank range while you stand in amazement with a pack of bandages and a backpack as your only items, or maybe the AK DOES actually spawn but you mash ""F"" to pick it up 28 times without being able to grab it and your enemy leasurely blows you away with a hand loaded revolver he managed to pick up 8 seconds ago. Prepare to fire into the walls or roof at random when your character decides to raise his weapon or unload a mag into the windowframe because of the ""sweet"" realistic gun barrel detection. All the while new skins and packs are added by the listless developer in a desperate attempt to cash in on fanboys and kids who have free access to daddy and mommy's credit card and promises fixes which haven't come for literally years (bugs from early alpha are still in the game unfixed) Don't take my word for it though, there are streamers with 30 times the playtime I have that have endlessly documented the sad state of the game in video format.

Yes the game can be fun, yes I still play (i've invested a lot of time and its a game me and my friends all can just go and chill and play) but recommend, no I can't do that, the game is a disaster and if past attempts are any indication it will probably continue to be so indefinitely. Maybe some day the devs will use the millions upon millions of dollars earned by this monstrosity to actual make an enjoyable game that will be played for years or decades and become a classic FPS like CSGO or Rainbow 6 Seige but my hopes aren't that high based on the past track record.

All in all I can't recommend it at this time, with a lot of work and effort this could be a great game, maybe even one of the greatest, but its still so far from that state and I sadly must question if getting it to that place is even that high of a priority due to recent DLC like the battlepass and constant adding of new content when so much of the game is in desperate need of repair.

Great game, let down by poor implementation.

So I have a friend who lives in Kazakstan and with whom my friends and I have been playing for a long time. We've been playing on Russian region, because that's where we live. He always had latency somewhat near 100ms which isn't so bad if you live in Kazakstan actually.

Just now, after the update (wich implied that the server will be picked automatically baced on your latency, yada yada, we tried to start a game. Well, it just don't start at all. When I press ""Ready"", I can see that I have the checkmark on my nickname in the game, he doesn't, and vise versa. Tried starting different game mods and squad options - still nothing. Sometimes there appears to be a disconnect icon on mine or his nickname (we are still talking about lobby, because we haven't managed to beat it yet).

So after all this we tried to start a solo game by ourselves. Guess what? I've been places on EU server, and he's been placed on Asian server (where he have 250ms ping, yeah).

There is also a matter of Russain servers, because that's a shitshow by itself. They aren't owned or at least operated by Bluehole. They are owned by Russain company ""Mail.ru"", and my guess is - Bluehole can't or just forgot to include them into their brand new region autoselect feature.

I finally decided to collect my thoughts and share them here.

PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (Henceforth known as Pubg) is a battle royale shooter, similar to ArmA 2/3 BR and H1Z1. The concept is simple, 100 players drop out of a plane over an island or a Trump-Wallesque desert, scrounge up the best gear they can find, and kill each other. Last man/woman standing wins, but you don't really need to hear that, the game has been out for nearly a year, and if you haven't heard of Pubg by now, then I don't even know anymore.

Pubg does a lot of things right. The gunplay, when it works correctly, is phenomenal. It feels tight and responsive, the bullet physics feel accurate, and especially rewarding when landing long range shots. This is arguably it's strongest suit. 
The original map that the game launched with 'Erangel' is a great mix of different terrains and hotspots allowing different routes to be taken in order to achieve victory, and is easily the stronger map of the two. The movement, for the most part is good. However I will touch on this a little later.

Despite the multitude of things that Pubg gets right, it gets so much wrong. Hackers are a major problem in this game, even after the implementation of PUBG Corp's proprietary Anti-Cheat. Wallhackers, Aimbotters, Norecoil. Hackers are rampant in this game. 
Ping abuse is another problem. There is a reason you see people spamming #RegionLockChina, and it's not an attempt at racist humour. Not in the slightest. People from countries such as China, tend to join NA and EU servers in order to abuse the fact thaat the desync in this game causes them to be able to demolish people without any issue due to the fact that they are next to impossible to shoot, due to their high ping.
Desync itself is still a major issue, with major rubberbanding, hit registration and a plethora of other issues still plaguing this game. A recent example of this would be when I unloaded 20 bullets from a Scar-L, point blank into an enemies chest, only for them to soak it up, turn around and drop me in two shots. The death cam registered three bullets hitting him. THREE. There was more than three blood sprays shooting from his body, so my client registered that bullets had hit, but the server did not. I was on an EU server, with 40 ping. This again ties in to my earlier point regarding movement. While the movement is pretty solid, the fact that the desync, coupled with the games rubberbanding issues are still present. Movement is more often than not a challenge. When your game struggles to handle something as basic as movement fluidly. We got a problem.

These issues, while major, could be overlooked to a certain extent if the game remained in early access. This is where one of my main gripes remains. This is sold to the end user as a finished product. A game rampant with hackers, lag issues, server desync, and basic hit registration issues, is not only being sold as a full game, but is also touted as 'eSports ready'. A game in which the chances of you actually hitting someone seem all but randomized, is considered 'eSports ready'.

However, none of my complaints matter at the end of the day. I bought the game, PUBG Corp/Bluehole made their money, and that's all that counts at the end of the day.

Do I recommend this game? Sure, I guess I do, winning in this game is a sheer adrenaline rush. It's unlike any other game I've ever played. 

Do I think you should buy this game? No. Not until this is a stable product, that has a handle on the hackers, has fixed the issues with servers, and has restricted access from players from a high ping locale.

TL:DR This game is good, but it's also trash. Play Fortnite instead, that actually works.

EDIT: To those thinking that my comment about playing Fortnite was real, it wasn't. I was being facetious, if anything it's worse than pubg, considerably so.

I really hate to rate it this way but the direction it is headed is NOT GOOD.

As a famous quote says ""I don't know you anymore. PUBG, you're breaking my heart. You're going down a path I can't follow."" 

The first major problem with the game is that hacking is rampant.... and I mean RAMPANT....  9 out of ever 10 matches you will encounter hackers. Mostly with names like 99998330287 and yes as much as I hate to join the club, it is 99% Chineses players that are hacking. 

2nd with the roll out of the new map tomorrow comes the ""NEW"" Event Pass system...  what is it you ask?  Well in a nutshell you will be paying for newmaps and items..  ( Think Fortnite )  the major difference there is Fortnite is free to begin with PUBG is not.... bad move ...  finding a new way to charge the playerbase more money... 

3rd the hit detection is just bad in this game... If you play it ... you will die a few seconds after you turn a corner and are moving away completely out of line of site... it will happen often.

Now having gotten why I gave it a thumbs down out of the way....  I have had a blast in this game and made several new gaming friends.  The game has provided me with hours of enjoyment and laughter along with some heartpounding intense moments in battles...

This is my second review on this game earlier I had given it a negetive rating because I was frustrated by the cheaters in almost every match.But that was more of a rant than a review.
Now before I begin (don't worry I will keep things short and precise) please note this is more of an informative review rather than a negetive review.

Like many others I got this game when it was in early access. I used to play it a lot with my friends and had some fun too. I even used to play it a lot in single player mode too when I was new and even then I liked it. But after spending 350+hours I started to get bored.If you are a person who likes to try out almost every type of game then you may enjoy it too for the first 100-200hrs with that you will also get your money's worth.
Now if you are looking for a fair competitive game then I would say look somewhere else as this game may not be for you. Mainly because its unfair and unbalanced.

In PUBG you spend 10 minutes in looting then another 10-15 mins either camping or running from the blue circle. If you are unlucky then you will get killed
soon after you have finished looting by someone from a location which you may not spot easily. Otherwise jump to a crowded location and start testing your luck.
If you take the first approach then for most of the time you ae literally doing nothing in the game except wasting time.
In the second scenario you may not even get a gun by looting a 2 storey house but your opponent will get it within few seconds inside a small house and will kill you with it.
In both scenario's you will either get frustrated and angry or satisfied momentarily (if you managed to kill someone).The game only becomes intense during the last 5 mins.
Loots are generally medical supplies to boost your health and gun attachments to increase the shot's accuracy.

These things may be fun for some people but not for me. But these are not the only reasons I left playing this game the main reasons are these :
1. BUGS. There are a lot of bugs in this game. Lot means a lot.Everyday people are discovering something new. You can headover to reddit to
know more about them. Due to these you may loose an easy win situation. I think many people including me have experienced this many times.
2.Server desync & bad ping are the biggest nonsense in this game.eg: I hit a guy many times but he didn't go down instead he kills me easily with max 2 shots? When I check the 
replay it shows that I only hit him once or twice.
3.Cheaters. Now they are very less compared to last few months. However you may come across 1 or 2 in a day compared to 1 in almost every match previously.(I have upoaded some videos
exposing some cheaters you can view them from my profile)

However bluehole has not solved some of the old bug issues yet (the parachute opening, item visibility while landing etc). Instead they are focussing on something else.
Battleroyale genre is like a fad and nothing else.Every one is jumping in it to make some quick profits till it lasts.
From battle royale genre I have only played PUBG & H1Z1 & I liked the later more. The current state of H1Z1 however is not good & I think PUBG will soon follow its path too.
I think the devs are aware of this too thats why they are trying to grab as much as they could during this time.

Anyways I have nothing against them personally its their decision to make money in whichever way they see fit.Currently I have not much interest in this game.
In the end I would just say getting it or not is completely your decision.

Novel in its approach, PUBG allowed people to enjoy the game in a few different ways until the matches reached their apex of tension with the ever shrinking circle of death. In the end, only one person could survive, being crowned with the phrase ""WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!"". But, for all of the novelty of this game the actual fun of the game quickly decreased only to be replaced with the frustration of a buggy system, a increasing amount of cheaters, and a cash grab for cosmetics. Having reached over 50 million sales, it is quite amazing that BlueHole would have felt the necessity to institute a pay for cosmetics out of loot crates that you earn from playing the game. What is the point of playing, when only one person can win a game, if the rewards can only be unlocked with real cash? It's certainly not because the game play is top notch.

I would have recommended this game, earlier, had they not instituted a pay-to-unlock-rewards policy. Instead of working on a flawed reward system it makes sense that they would have focused on working out the bugs and decreasing cheaters so that the game remains an enjoyable experience. For all of their statements about working out their kinks and combatting a slew of cheating programs, they've accomplished very little actual progress in regards to those goals. Every patch seems to introduce a new level of bugs while hindering performance in some way. These performance drops being explained away as anti-cheat software negatively impacting performance actually show no signs of slowing down the cheaters. In the games before I stopped playing, I had so few matches end because I lost fairly and not because a cheater was shooting out of a car which was halfway across the map and getting headshots even though the player wasn't even aiming. 

PUBG has one good thing going for it, if not depressing in hindsight, that developers can publish an unpolished game and then reap the benifits of a flawed system that they have no intention of correcting because for every ban they hand out they then receive one more sale.

In the beginning, everything was fine. The game was playable, for the most part: it may have been riddled with server issues and a lack of optimization, but it was fun! The one map it had was slowly being refined, and as Early Access drew to an end and 1.0 approached, promises of an all new, even better map were frequently made.
And then they added microtransactions before the game even left early access, in the form of the same cosmetic crates that CS:GO  had. Needless to say this left a bitter taste in the mouth of some longtime fans, as the devs had promised before that microtransactions wouldn't even be discussed until after the game left Early Access. Still, these items had no impact on gameplay outside of the normal gamer need to show off your FABULOUS fashion collection to every other play you see.
And then they turned off the marketplace completely, meaning now it was no longer possible to trade cosmetic items at all, no hope of ever obtaining the ever-allusive schoolgirl attire or movie-inspired yellow tracksuit outside of dumping thousands of dollars into lootcrates and the keys required to open them. Eventually the marketplace would return, but many of the most desirable items are now strictly non-tradeable.
Shortly before the 1.0 launch the game received some desperately needed optimization and bug fixes, giving hope to the game's now record-breaking playerbase, however the game still had many, many technical issues. Even worse, with the influx of new players came a rise in cheaters. Even as I write this years past the exodus from Early Access, the game has received precious little in the way of optimization. It's playable, but it's nowhere near the level of polish it should have after so much time spent soaking up player funds. In all, the developers of the game have long since abandoned any pretext of actually listening to what the playerbase wants. Every now and then we get maybe some new cosmetics we can purchase with real-world money from the cash shop, but none of the gameplay or QOL improvements that we've been asking for since the beginning.
My chief complaint with the game's current state actually has it's source in the game's best selling point. Credit where credit is due: the developers have been pumping out fresh new maps in a way other games in the Battle Royale genre don't dare. We've gone from having 2 maps at launch to now having 4 fresh, diverse maps each with their own unique themes and play styles. With the 1.0 Launch and the arrival of the second map, we were given the highly-sought-after map select feature.
And then they replaced that with a ""Playlist"" select feature, as they launched a third map some months later. So now your choice was either the new 3rd map, or a random selection between the first 2 maps. Needless to say, the reaction to this was lukewarm. Why was this needed? I can't say for sure, but I imagine the developers were unhappy with how many players still preferred the original map over the two newer offerings. So now they've added a feature universally loved only to take it away and replace it with a shallow, useless copy. It was at this point that I quit playing PUBG all together. I no longer felt as if the developers cared for their players at all and merely saw the game, and the people who play it, as an endless source of income, a project they could give minimal work to while ensuring profits, and of course their own continued employment.
I returned to PUBG recently in the late Summer of 2019 to see where the game currently stood. It has changed, somewhat, and not for the better in my opinion. There is now a cash shop where you can buy your cosmetics directly if you don't have the patience or funds to keep buying keys to open the lootcrates, and of course there are many different varieties of crates, with their own keys, to ensure that the whales who keep buying microtransactions don't spend money on just one thing, but several. The map select is gone entirely. When you prepare to queue for a match, your only option is ""Random Map"", containing the 4 current maps, and virtually guaranteeing that you won't actually get to play the map you want to play, when you want to play it. Once inside an actual match, the only real changes toward gameplay I noticed were some instances of UI bloat, as keybinds now feature directly on the screen, and some changes to the initial drop taken from Fortnite, like the ability to press a button to glide or fast descent, as well as new UI art for the airspeed and heading elements. Once on the ground, the game plays exactly the same. A few art assets had been changed, although I wouldn't say they were necessarily better than they were before. Certain houses had wallpaper on the walls where before they had been plain wood, some doors now looked a bit more defined than they had been before. I played a few rounds in a row, and then I uninstalled the game once more.
All in all I have to say that PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds is a special milestone in the history of the BR genre, but not one that's needed moving forward. There are other games out there now that handle better, play better, and perform better. PUBG has somewhat stiffer controls than other games you might be used to playing now, far worse optimization, stability issues, an over-priced cash shop, and an aesthetic that is wholely boring and unoriginal with it's washed-out colors and dirty browns and beiges. I can't recommend it at all, it'll only get worse from here.",1566783223,1566783223,False,151,9,0.776543796062469482,0,True,False,False

Current problem with the game and why i can't recommend the game:

- There are rubberbanding Issues which results in you not being able to pick up items you are standing op top of even if you spam the pick up item key, which can be crucial and often times outright deadly.

- There are no region lock (this is a problem because the majority of the playerbase is chinese (41% of the player base) and do to an uther lack of competence from the creator of the game Brendon Green they are forced to pay a monthy fee to get access to the game or use a VPN service so they can get around that, and to try and avoide that the chinese players are joining american and european servers, which results in people with an horrible ping will be joining servers they wore never supose to be playing at in the first place (some times you can even be downed by player you have already downed yourself...)

- There is a huge cheating problem in the game. (99% of all cheaters are chinese (this number is taken from the banned list, im not making it up, 99% of all cheaters are from china, so this creates a huge problem for none chinese players when chinese players play on none chinese servers. 

- People have been banned for the crime of shooting Twitch Streamers (doesn't matter if you have a twitch account watching the stream or not, just the act of shooting a streamer have gotten people perma banned from the game.

- People have been banned for driving around the game honking the horns in the cars.

- People have been banned for shoting people that join Squads as randoms who shot their team mates... ye that's right, shoting a teamkiller in selfdefence against other teamkillers have gotten people Permabanned from the game.

- The Anti cheating ""service"" is more incompetent than Brendon Green. (people have been banned by the system even though they didn't cheat, hundreds of people wore banned and unbanned because of the anti cheat system made false flags)

- The Driving Physics of the game is the worst i have played it years.

- The Creator of the game Brandon Green said that the game would never have Micro Tranctions or loot boxes (he later added them anyway. he also states in a interview that any player complaining about the ""cheater problem or wanting region locking to stop people running around on servers they never should have been on Xenophobic and racists bigots.

- Last update on the number of PUBG bans: 1,500,000 Dec 28, 2017 (not all accounts banned that was banned was banned for cheating)

-February 16: PUBG has sold over 30 million copies according to Steam Spy.
So a total of 5% of all copies sold have been banned...

Conclution: I still cannot reccomend the game.",1516899527,1542848918,False,78,3,0.776436209678649902,6,True,False,False

It's not a game of skill and thought. It's ""Who has the best rig"" vs. ""Who can anticipate the lagginess of the game"".

It's not polished. It takes a tremendous machine just to make the game playable at all. And it's not stable, it'll kick you out in the middle of a game without warning. 

The only real enjoyment I get is from playing with friends. If you don't have someone who specifically wants to play the game with you you aren't going to have a good time. You'll run around for 20 minutes collecting loot for the person who kills you without you seeing them. 

It's not a game in the sense that you want to win. The goal is to ruin someone else's game. Because every kill is a frustration for someone, every death is a chore of ""well, now I have to do all that shit again.""

The real game is the last 10 people. Everything else is just random time filler where you probably won't see anyone. You're just running in an emtpy field looking for the one (of a dozen) weapons that you can win with. 

And ultimately, I just can't reccomend the game. It's too unrefined, it's too frustrating to play, and the only payoff is the knowledge that you ruined someone else's night.

EDIT: So after a six month break with the game I decided to pick it up again. The first two or three hours of that was trying to resolve a glitch where I was unable to run after aiming down gun sights. I ended up wiping my controller configuartions and re-installing the game. That seems to have worked.

Disregarding that there are a few things that have changed since my review. New maps, new guns, but the biggest change of all is in performance. My gun hits what it's aiming at instead of what the server thinks I'm aiming at. That's a massive plus to the game.

Ultimately though I still stand by my old review. The core of the game is frustration and unless you have a friend who specifically wishes to play with you I can't reccomend the game.",1529132458,1545533261,False,245,18,0.775277972221374512,20,True,False,False

To begin with, the core gameplay itself is still dominated by so many bugs, exploits and cheaters that it's difficult to actually tell if someone is cheating or if the game is just itself broken. Killcam weapons will snap to targets and be mysteriously absent of recoil. Players will know where you are through walls and floors. That kind of thing. The odds of fighting more than 2 or 3 groups before encountering a cheater or a could-be are so high that I don't think I can name a single time it's happened in my 200 hours of play. Ever.

That's not to say cheating is the only technical problem. A year after the game left early access and it's still a technically unsound, bug-riddled MESS in every aspect, from gunplay to vehicles to animations. The game is an unoptimized piece of shit, a problem which has only gotten worse. I use an R9-380 and FX8320 with 16 gigs of ram, totalling out at a solid machine. Playing on the lowest dirt settings where the game looks like a mobile port. The loading screens still occasionally take longer than the opening lobbies or even the entire plane ride for dropping. Distance models are frequently present upon landing, and loot doesn't load in sometimes for more than 30 seconds after I hit the ground, but only for me or anyone else affected - if you're fortunate enough to load the game in time, you have full access!

But of course, it's too limiting to say that the game's problems are limited to ONLY bugs, since there's also a slew of poor choices from PUBG corp to back up the idea. Why do players make less noise when they take their shoes off? Why are so many of the weapons noob traps? Why doesn't everyone spawn with a pistol? Why is this game so determined to be absolutely random in how it assigns weapons and gear?

The microtransactions and loot boxes are not just unnecessary, not just added post launch, not just insulting as a concept and in their implementation into this mess of a game, but downright compromise any progression experience the game offers because of it. The loot boxes that this game added undermine the core experience so severely that if you are interested in playing more than a couple games, you're shelling out anywhere from 5-15$ a week to be able to purchase keys for the rewards that you EARNED, most of the drops are either disgustingly ugly or completely unnoticable.

And none of this is even TOUCHING on the fundamental gameplay formula, which alternates between long periods of extensive all-encompassing boredom, and moments of life-or-death gameplay where if you were unfortunate enough to stop paying attention during that 10-minute run into the circle, you are killed instantly.

If I could, I would go back and stop myself from ever buying a copy of this game, and put that money towards anything else on my wish list. I'd put it towards gas in my car, or a couple of pizzas. The idea of PUBG being so successful is so emblematic of the gaming industry as a whole - successful despite being fundamentally broken, unoriginal, not fun to play, and in return for making billions, the developers implemented wave after wave of loot boxes instead of fixing it.

PUBG is fundamentally broken and anti-fun to play in every respect. If you read this, please, go buy something - literally anything - else instead.",1544205150,1544205150,False,487,48,0.774671435356140137,26,True,False,False

These developers are immature to think that Fortnite is a direct copy of PUBG and that they would win with games such as H1Z1 and Black Ops 4 out there as well.

TL;DR This game had potential, but it is not worth the money anymore.

It started off as one of the best battle royale games, putting to shame H1Z1 or ARK. Early access, it was obviously unready, but it was still fun to play and there were no microtransactions. It was hard to run, but the potential for the game was high. So much could have been done to improve it and make it a competitor for AAA games.

But then the devs got greedy and made it into a money farm. 

The game came out in December of 2017 and still today is very unoptimized. I see that there are indeed new game modes and maps to try and combat this, but it is too little too late. This game in its current engine will most likely never reach a level of optimization that is acceptable for the amount of time that has past since the launch date. With the introduction of loot boxes, this game has just become a cash grab. Not to mention that since it has been on the Steam store, it has [u]never[/u] gone on sale.

Overall, it was fun in the beginning, but the disrespect from developers to consumers with the introduction of microtransactions has sent this game towards its grave.

The problem is still a strong mixture of the Chinese playerbase's rampant abuse of hacks and the devs doing absolutely nothing to fix the problem. Despite the ""fix PUBG"" campaign they have rolled out hackers are as common if not more common than ever with it being easy to find 5-6 per game by spectating after death, all of them always being Chinese.

Not to mention the other downside now being the long queue times thanks to the playerbase dying due to the previous paragraph's issues. When I first wrote this review there were 3 million players daily, now there is less than a million on average. You know something is dreadfully wrong with the game when it loses 66+% of its playerbase in 8 months.

I've got quite a few hours in this game, not enough to be a no-life but enough to know how it is. Let me break some things down for you about this game.


It's almost unplayable. The sheer number of cheaters (literally almost all if not all are from China) has been growing steadily for over a month. Ever since more and more Chinese players have migrated to the North American servers the  population of cheaters has skyrocketed. Allow me to list what will happen to you regularly:

- You will join a lobby and all you will hear is a dozen plus voices shouting in Chinese with the occasion expletive in English. 
- You will drop and find supplies as normal
- You will run in to a solo/group/duo/etc. as expected
- Instead of banter during the firefight all you hear is shrieking and yelling in Chinese (They talk in-game A LOT for some reason)
- You will be instantly shot in the head after you leave cover (often before too) by somebody who was 100 meters+ away and was not even aiming down their sights, just hip firing.
- You will be angry that you were killed by a cheater
- You will take a break for a few minutes
- You will go back to the top of this list.

Literally of the last 5 games I have played 4 of my 5 deaths have been to Chinese who were cheating on the North American servers. I will tell the story of the last death.

Partner and I were on a rooftop picking up a couple items, I see two players brazenly jogging down the middle of the road, one not wearing pants (A telltale sign it is a Chinese player), and tell my partner to get ready to attack them. At this point we have not at any point crested the barrier between us, but the enemy player in front of the duo has been looking directly at my position on a roof in the middle of town the whole way down the road. I told my partner to shoot and within a half second of him standing and taking his first shot he was knocked on the ground, I had also stood up when I said to shoot and I was on the ground almost instantly after my partner. Watching the death cam revealed the instant we both stood up the same player headshot both of us, while running, while firing from the hip. Their target reticule was as large as it could possibly be, yet they managed to hit both of us in the head twice in less than a second at 50 meters while moving and not aiming. 

You could think it was a wildly lucky shot, but when the same scenario has happened twice before tonight alone, it isn't coincidence that all the players doing this magical shots are all Chinese and assuredly cheating. 

I'm not bad at the game, I have multiple wins under my belt, I know what a good player acts like, and none of the Chinese players who kill me act like that.


The game is broken. Not because of in-game glitches or errors (of which there are more than a few, freezing on start is a big one) but because there are hundreds of thousands of cheaters, literally. The developers of the game have openly admitted that a vast majority of the cheating players are Chinese, but sternly refuse to region lock the game and keep the Chinese players on the Chinese servers. They claim it is ""unfair"" to keep the ""good players"" out because of ""a few bad eggs"" However a ""few bad eggs"" is the majority of over 1,500,000 banned cheaters. It is more unfair to the few Chinese players that do not cheat to be forced to play with all their cheating brethren than it is to the entirety of the EU, NA, SA, SEA, etc. communities and players, who are all burdened by the massive influx of cheaters from a single region.

Even if you have a server with low latency, there is still about 3-10% packet loss every now and then.
(I'm sporting a stable 400mbit cable connection, no problems of that kind with any other online game)

The game mechanics, especially the weapon/hitbox physics are horribly unreliable.
Shoot someone in the face (aiming) with revolver 2 Meters away: under 20% damage to their healthbar. (Lag? Spread?)
Shoot and visibly hit someone 4 times to the chest with SKS, they just turn around and oneshot you with M4 or Scar from 50 Meters away (twoshot, if you are wearing lv2 armor and lv2 helmet, and of course their first two spray shots hit and knock you out instantly)
A squadmate once shot (and hit) someone THRICE with M24 and that guy was still running.

The worst thing in my opinion is the totally inaccurate Killcam, which isn't even barely in sync with what a player has done, seen or aimed at. My Squad got at least two cheaters banned by report, but most of the time it is just impossible to tell if someone was playing fair because the killcam is doing wierd moves, or lagging behind the actual movement. (Even CoD4: Modern Warfare had an accurate Killcam 10 years ago)

Another thing that bugs me a lot is the discrepancy of audible noise between your instance and the server.
You can go sneak around with your character and literally hear nothing, no indication of your own footsteps... and everyone else around you will hear your steps as if you were running normally. You cannot rely on the noise you make. EVER.

TL;DR
This game is frustrating trash, and it is getting worse.

Battlegrounds is a game that has found meteoric success over the last few months attracting millions of bloodthirsty players ready to fight to the death, but not all of them want to play by the rules. Depending on who you ask PUBG either has a serious hacking problem that affects every game or cheaters are barely noticeable, rare unicorns witnessed every one hundred games or so. Whichever side of the fence you sit on, PUBG has banned roughly tens of thousands of hackers in the last three months, so they're certainly out there. You may very well have played with a hacker, but the truth is you'd never know it, if the hacker slowly stalked you using ESP, an ability that grants the cheater extra sensory perception of your location at all times. You'd just think you were unlucky. You can't win every game after all.

Hacking communities are notoriously secretive and for obvious reasons, but this often leaves their motives shrouded in stereotypes. Common opinion paints them as vindictive children with too much time on their hands and a penchant for mischief, but surely they can't all be like that? Some of these hacks aren't cheap. 

So back to the game....

FPP or TPP?

My opinion on FPP vs. TPP: First off I prefer FPP over TPP. When it comes to watching I prefer, to watch FPP. The reason being is gameplay is more exciting. You can play more aggressively, higher kill games are more common. Gun skill becomes more a factor. People have to take risk to gain information in FPP, you can't just sit behind your cover and see everything that is happening around you. You have to understand when to peek, what directions to be watching. You can snowball fights, If I engage someone in FPP and damage them heavily, they either have to turn to fight me, or retreat to cover. If they retreat to cover they’re now blind to my movements, I can flank them, reposition and attack them from another angle. The enemy player after being caught off guard, or losing the initial engagement has to understand where I can move on him. He either needs to predict my movements, or take a risk to gain information by peeking, and then responding accordingly. If that same scenario happens in TP, as soon as the guy gets to cover he is safe. He can med, he can see all my movements, I can't push him. It becomes a stalemate. Whoever moves first more often than not will die in this situation. Gameplay is slowed down, and aggression is halted. There's way more action in FPP that's why I prefer watching it. There's a ton of game sense that comes into play in first. Since you don't have some camera floating up behind your character, with a super wide FOV. When it comes to what one is more skilled, both require a large amount of skill to do really well in at the highest level. At the end of the day when it comes to the more skilled mode, I have to give it to FPP though.",1514210683,1514210683,False,107,4,0.744778633117675781,16,True,False,False

Seriously though, this game is one of the most fun games on the market.  It runs far better than it used to, and every patch seems to bring more and more improvements.  However, there is one glaring problem: Chinese hackers.  

NA servers are INFESTED with Chinese hackers.  I never noticed the issues until recently, perhaps with the implementation of the kill cam.  My partner and I are top .5% in duos, and the game is borderline unplayable at times.  Half the time we get killed, it is by someone with a name like 'ahskf5834732843' or 'lin-feng-838912839'.  Upon review of the kill cam, they are tracking us through walls and snapping straight to where we are even when there is no possible way they knew where we were that fast! The event that caused me to write this review was someone killing us both from 400+ yards away with an iron sights AKM WITHOUT LAYING OFF THE TRIGGER.  Chinese hackers are sucking the fun out of this game.

The game is fun for the first month or two after buying, but it doesn't take long before you start to get tired of the same two maps and same bugs every damn time. I've had a lot of fun playing this with my friends, but also a lot of strife trying to get it working and dealing with the numerous bugs/hackers that plague the game. 

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
+ Realistic graphics
+ Great gun mechanics
+ High population (easy to find a match)
+ Easy to learn, hard to master
+ Feels great to win, can be intense

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- Slow loading times
- Black screens, random crashes
- Terrible main menu UI
- Laggy gameplay (especially at start)
- Only 2 maps
- Poorly implemented vaulting system
- Buggy (dozens of bugs, differing in severity)
- Abundance of hackers
- Glitchy vehicle physics/controls
- Uncaring devs
- Annoying fans obsessed with hating on Fortnite because they're insecure *UPDATE*

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
If you can get past the bugs, the glitches, and the hackers, the base game itself is really solid, the gun mechanics feel great and the realistic graphics look nice. Which is why it's a shame that everything else is a total mess. 

For the price of the game and the quality of the updates I don't recommened buying it. Instead of fixing and improving their game, the Devs decided to ignore the playerbase and focus on creating lazy gun skins and bringing out regular cosmetic lootboxes, all this after rushing an early release for Xmas sales....

It had (and still has) its problems like hit detection, server lag ... but it was fun. You had time to loot nearly wherever you wanted in the beginning, you could do nearly every strategy or tactic you liked, whether you jumped directly to a high loot area, took a vehicle and moved to the far end of the zone or you looted your way along some houses to the zone... All these strategies worked for people.
The mid-game was quiet, I have often seen or heared no one till there were only 20 people left. I have to say, that my favourite strategy back then was ""I drop far far away and dont`t go to the cities"", so this could have been a side effect, and other people would see this different.
But nonetheless I liked it, how it was. It was a great game!

But then...
then they made the first adjustments to the blue zone. It wasn`t much and back then, I thought it was to optimize things for all of us. But I was wrong! For the last half year they made many ""small"" adjustments to the zone (faster starting, more damage, more DOT the further you are away) to get PUBG ready for e-sports. Nearly everything in this matter was to appease the e-sports community, which wanted a faster gameplay, because the old was to boring for the spectators. I feel sad about this and it angers me a lot, that because of a small part the whole PUBG community has to suffer. That the loudest in the community are probably fast-paced-shooter-lovers, who cry ""faster, faster, faster!"", make it even worse, because all the other voices who liked the game how it was, were drowned in the loud ones.

And now....
update #10. 
I have already played some matches with the new update and I have to say, that I DON`T LIKE it! Sometimes I wasn`t even at the ground when the first timer was already ticking! How should I loot if I have to move instantly to get to the zone?! Maybe I`ll have time then... oh sorry 2nd zone starts in 90s (200s before), you need to go! Oh, you`ve taken damage? You are at the edge of the blue? You need to heal? No time! 3rd circle starts in 60s (150s before) and you have far to go! If you are unlucky and the first zone is far away and you have no car, you can probably give up, because you will most likely not be able to reach the circle before it moves again. And since they added extra damage the further you are outside the circle... RIP...

Also with this update, there isn`t any time for tactics anymore. Dropping far away, thinking how you engage an enemy or attack a building takes too much time. You will have to move before you can do it. In addition, they increased the chance that the new circle is in the center of the old one, even the last circle will shrink to the middle! They took away the last bit of fairness in this game. Now everybody will go for the middle because the circle will probably be there. What will come next? I don`t want a game where I can make a list of what I'll have to do next! This is just boring. If I wanted a boring game, I wouldn`t have bought it!


Please undo at least the horrible changes to the zone you did in update #10!
I WANT MY OLD PUBG BACK!!!

edit 14.04.2018:
I really apreaciate it, that the devs undid the changes to the zone! I also hope that next time, they put big changes like these much longer to the test servers than for update #10, so that something like this won`t happen again.

Maybe try the slower zones as in #10 and zone 2 with 180s, zone 3 with 120s, zone 4 with 90s and the rest like #10 with 60s cooldown. That is a bit faster but should be enough time to loot and fight.
And one solution for those who like a faster game/copetitive mode would be extra servers. So you could choose if you want to play on normal mode or the faster e-sports mode.",1523543929,1523721992,False,216,13,0.737624466419219971,18,True,False,False

Instead, it's become exactly what we all hate. They could have taken the $730 billion dollars and put it into the game, hiring new talents to optimize it, make anti-cheat software, create addicting levels and polish the game to the point that most AAA titles could only dream. 

They got greedy. 

It doesn't matter how many hours you sink into their game, or the $30 you spent on the experience. They wanted more. They claim they need to continue making money after making nearly $1 billion dollars. So, they turned the crates you earned through game time into loot box items that were locked behind keys you had to pay for, which in turn has incentivized rampant cheating, ruining the game.

Now, they're trying to sue a company that is more successful for using their one gimmick that they stole from another game. 

On top of that, they've added an ""event pass"" to rent items that will expire and introduced XP? 

Any criticisms from the community that wants it to do well is met with anger and hubris from the community managers. 

This game has truly lost it's way and no in-game experience can wash away the taste of absolute greed from a company that treats it's community simply like dollar signs.

I do believe if you know how to google, you can find out the cheating and hack problem is serious. If you think there are no hacker, cheater in this game. I got a bad news for you. You should go to check your brain to see if it is damaged.


However, that is good. No matter they are real supporter/Fanboy of this sh!t game or they are paid commenter hired by this Sh!t company. The more people left their comment at this post, the more people will be able to see the truth.

This sh!t company already made a lot of money because of this sh!t game. That's why they can hire people to upvote and leave supportive comment here.

If you ever have a clear mind, just go to the PUBG steam forum. It is occupied by Chinese words. These are selling hacks, aimbots and full of spam. This Sh!t company don't even try to clean it up.

Their attitude are clear. They already made enough money and don't give a sh!t about cheater and hacks. Everytime they said how many account was banned due to cheating and hacking, I know it is a lie. I knew it.

Honestly, I don't expect people stop playing this sh!t game. I can't change people's mind by just a post. 

But I want my post as a reminder for those people who are thinking to purchase this game. I hope you to think twice before throw your money away.

Lastly, Please think twice before buying other product of this Korea company in future.

P.S** If you think my math is wrong, or my skill is suck. You are feel free to think so. Just share this post on Facebook, Twitter or other forum. as much as you can.

Let's have some fun.The listed ""Genius"" below failed to understand players can wall hacking and aimbotting at the same time.

Let's have a look of what comment they have left. 

Big Niger: ""125% of people cheat makes sense""

N3RDZTV: ""90% + 5% + 5%= 100% Learn your math :)""

skripe : ""thx for the advice. 125% total people use hacks right?""

Ruessev : ""I mean ya, lot's of hackers, but not as many as you are saying. Also, 90% + 30% + 5% = 125% xD""

RedSia: "" %90 + %30 + %5 = %125 lol?""

BLΛƆKPIИK.Jisoo: "" man, you really need a mathematics book for that sick math skills :3""

Lagger : ""at the end you'd find the math is wrongly calculated xDD""

Colgate V1 : "" Am I the only one upset about his horrible math 90 + 30 + 5 = 125""

Gyro Zeppeli : ""90% + 30%??? that doesn't quite add up that would be 120% which the max percentage is 100%. Maybe you are a child.""

Nugget : ""your bad at math. please add me to wall of fame""

Squid: ""I don't think you know how percentages work""

I really appreciate above ""Genius"" who have showed us that stupidity is way beyond human's imagination.

You guys are very entertaining. Thank you for the joy.

Also, a special thank you for those who tried so hard to explain logic to those ""Genius"".
Really appreciate your explaination. However, you can't really speak logic with those fanboy. Just like you can't argue with someone, telling them earth is a sphere, while they truly believe earth is flat. 

well. maybe PUBG fanboy is as ""Genius"" as those flat earther. 

Sorry for the bad English. English is my 4th language, hope you guys enjoy my review and share it as much as you can.~",1563453278,1566045546,False,730,254,0.731802046298980713,146,True,False,False

I quit this game for the same reason I quit CS:GO. Two game killing reasons:

#1: Lagg Compensation
Very stupid technology that should NOT be used in competitive games. If you don't know what Lagg Compensation is, let these two examples encourage you to uninstall:

#1.1: You're 100% certain you hit someone in the head. Yet you miss, and on the replay it shows you missed. WHY? Lagg Compensation.

#1.2: You're 100% certain that you managed to escape behind a wall, but you die anyways, as if your butt had expanded far and beyond the depths of the universe, into the black hole of the gun-pipe shooting at you. WHY? Lagg Compensation.


#2: CHEATERS
Do I need to explain this?
It used to be at least ONE cheater in every match you played. However, things have changed... there are more hackers now. In the past you would hope that a team would have killed the hacker half-way into the match. But nonono, now YOU will have to deal with a hacker ALMOST every game.

(Just because someone else has to deal with the hacker, doesn't mean there are no hackers. This line exists for the braindead).

So what kind of cheaters will you find in this game?

Wallhack

Aimbot

No-Recoil

Walk-Through-Walls, (No-Clip. Yes, you can be looking at a door, waiting for the enemy to open it and walk out into your line of fire... yet you die for some reason. The death cam shows the enemy peeking through the wall to your far right, taking his time aiming at your head... because somewhere in this cheater's heart, there is diginity, the dignity not to use aimbot, because only noob cheaters use aimbot, real cheaters walk through walls and take their mother fu***** time to aim, right? (S-A-R-C-A-S-M)).

Radar-Hack, they see every player on the map.

Speed hack

And other types of hacks that make losers feel better about themselves. Too bad there is no life-hack for them, ha ha ha, get it?


#3 Random Bugs, that you would expect would have been fixed after years in testing.

---------------

So those were the cons, now it is time for the pros:

Meh, I guess if you don't take the game seriously and just play for fun, then who cares! Do some roleplaying, enjoy driving around in a car or boat. Troll people like going inside their car, or make traps. Stalk people and see how far you can make it before they realize it. There is plently of fun to have in this game as long as you don't play competitively.

Concerning Lagg Compensation
Yes, lagg compensation is very good in online Player vs Environment situations. But not so in Player vs Player situations. It is just a lazy technology for cheap game developers NOT to invest in many server points spread out across the globe, who instead focus on BIG server points in specific areas in the world. It is a technology born because of the current limitation in data transfer over large distances; to compensate for the discrepancy caused by the physical distance that DATA has to travel; from the processor sending the DATA, to the processor receiving the DATA. The only thing lagg compensation does, is cover up the DATA loss, it doesn’t actually solve the physical issue (only a physical solution can solve a physical issue, one progress is IPv6, but that was the solution for a completely different problem). What lagg compensation tries to do is repair the damage VIRTUALLY using a prediction algorithm to decide what really happening. Basically, it tells the server to run a simulation… taxing the server’s processor… all while the game is still running for the other players. Now imagine this process running for every bullet that every player shoots. That’s a lot of wasted processing power just to satisfy customers who cry over “choppy” movements. But lagg compensation also works with movement prediction technology. Which means that during the simulation, the server will try to predict your movement using what IT BELIEVES you wanted to do. So let’s say you hold W, and then you see an enemy so you push A to dodge their line of fire. Here is the funny part. The simulation might predict that as if you were moving forward while strafing to the left, instead of stopping your forward movement. This explains that rubber-banding-feeling where you go “heeey, that’s not right, I didn’t even move there”, it is because the simulation is based on the PREDICTION of your movement, not your actual input. Lagg compensation is actually great for people with slow reaction times, however, for people with a fast reaction time… it is bullshit. Games feel heavy, character movement is clumsy, and unresponsive, even if we have a super computer and the best connection available. But yes, lagg compensation is very important, to give customers a smooth experience… however, please don’t pretend that it is competitive gaming, because that’s just bullshit.",1536437405,1537817708,False,336,62,0.713133752346038818,47,True,False,False

Poor server performance, and hackers.

The game essentially moves at the pace of the slowest, so you'll find yourself killed full seconds after making it behind cover, or lay shots into someone, only to learn they haven't registered on their end.

Greene was the one who said that around 90% of the cheaters in this game are located in China. If it was the US that was causing 90% of the problem, people would ask to region lock the players located in the US from European servers and visa versa. Calling people xenophobic just because they are westerners when they have very valid points that have nothing to do with race is pretty racist in my opinion.

A game with a lot of potential with high hardware requirements, but ruined, brought down and destroyed by Chinese cheaters and the development team who refuse to solve the problem. Do [b]NOT[/b] buy.

[i]Feel free to ask any specific questions you have and I will answer right away.[/i]

[u]Review[/u]
At its heart, the concept of gameplay that PUBG has developed is extremely fun. It offers a unique combination of first person shooter skills, third person strategy, teamwork, randomness and luck, that makes the rare wins exhilarating and memorable, and the many, many, many lost games frustrating. In addition, the inclusion of vehicles, the need to travel long distances, and the random glitches sometimes produce moments of hilarity and laugh-out-loud ludicrousness that itself provides entertainment making the game worth the price.

However, all of this is severely tainted by two major problems. 

First, the game is severely unoptimized, buggy, and laggy. The netcode is a disaster, with round-the-corner damage very common, and unrecognized hits on enemies. Server performance varies from game to game and region to region. Desynchronization between the players and servers is a regular occurrence, and was in fact horrendous at the time of the official 1.0 release, which was rushed out before Christmas 2017 in order to garner the most sales. 

This led to major rubber-banding, where if more than 5 or 6 people landed in the same area at the beginning of the match, you would all be fighting the server more than each other, as you took one step forwards only to be pulled two steps back as the servers struggled to synchronize everyone’s positions. Later updates did improve the situation, but a lot of damage has been done.

The next issue is hacking. Cheats are readily available for the game, and aimbot, speedhack, no recoil, wallhack, invisibility and other hacks are all in use. The cheaters are rampant and destroy most matches with their illegal and unfair advantages. I have played many other games for hundreds of hours, and have never seen such a prevalence of cheaters anywhere before. It is completely out of control and destroys the community, the gaming experience, and leads to a complete waste of precious leisure time.

These two problems, desynchronization and cheating, are exploited the most by Chinese players. All the cheaters I have come across are Chinese, and all the abuse of the netcode, by using high ping to sponge bullets, is also done by Chinese players. We know they are Chinese based on their names, or because they have long numbers and letters for names but speak loudly in all-chat in Mandarin. 

Furthermore, they often enter Solo games but while in the pre-game lobby they communicate with each other and team up, and then play in squads against the rest of the server who are playing as individual solo players. This is called “teaming” and is a banning offence, however it is not being policed. There is also evidence of “teaming” even in squad games, where 10 or more Chinese players make teams (when 4 is the maximum per team), using the in-game clothing items to coordinate and organize themselves. They have flooded every regional server, be it EU, NA, Australia, or Korea/Japan.

The reason I do not recommend this game is ultimately not because of these issues as such, but because of the response of the developers. 

Being the most popular game on Steam and the most popular game in China with the largest population in the world, the developers have no financial incentive to shut down and ban Chinese accounts – even if they do, the cybercafés where most of these Chinese hackers play from will have made more than enough money to buy a new account for their customers to continue cheating from. Cheats mean fun for Chinese players, money for the developers, but misery for everyone else in the world.

The developers have known about netcode and game optimization issues from the beginning, but have instead focussed on a rushed Xbox port, commercialization through loot crates, and lucrative deals, such as a mobile-phone version for the Chinese market. They have not fixed the structural problems with the game, and have done nothing about the cheaters. What’s worse, they even shut down all discussion about Chinese cheaters.

The game requires a very powerful PC to run smoothly, with a 10 series Nvidia card (preferably 1070 or higher), 16GB RAM, and at least a recent i5 processor. There is no way the minimum requirements of an “i3, 6GB RAM and a GTX 660” can run this game. I had to upgrade my graphics card and RAM before I could play this properly. I have supported this game since Early Access and also having invested so much money and time into what is clearly a great concept, the game is not recommendable because of the terrible playing experience brought about by the Chinese cheaters and the developers’ stubborn refusal to address the issue.

[u]Conclusion[/u] 
Not recommended. DO [b]**NOT**[/b] BUY.

I will only recommend the game when Chinese players are region-locked to their own regional servers, and when all the netcode and hitregistry issues are sorted out. We don’t need bells and whistles but some basic stability and a fair playing environment for all paying customers.",1516109055,1516192659,False,20,1,0.676320910453796387,5,True,False,False

After playing countless hours of H1Z1, The Culling, and Arma3 Battle Royale, i could tell that PUBG was headed in the right direction with a lot of potential. And oh how i was woefully wrong. I've played countless hours of PUBG, and over time, my excitement dwindled and i got slowly more and more fed up with all of the bullshit. Nowadays it's pretty difficult for me to enjoy the game at all, after all of the faith i initially put into the concept and the designers.

For my experience, i tend to not pay attention to hackers, and i never got banned for false stream sniper accusations, so my opinion i'm expressing here is purely on game design and execution. However, it's worth looking into the way the devs have handled PR and hackers, but i won't go into it. My main issues are with the bland and tired game design choices that the devs keep making after their player base clearly voicing their lack of appreciation for it.

[b] Glaring issues: [/b]

1. The graphical fidelity tied to performance. Or lack thereof. Now, granted this problem has been addressed pretty well with full release, before then, the game either looked like ass or ran like ass, and there was zero inbetween. Even with full release, it still has to look pretty sub-par for our generation of systems to run as well as a battle royale shooter should.

2. The gunplay. I've been pretty spoiled by Escape From Tarkov in terms of gunplay recently, but I also have too many hours across the various Arma titles, and i love my guns irl, and PUBG's gunplay is atrocious in comparison. Bullets travel at a painfully slow speed to where you have to pretend you're shooting BB guns at people leading four or five body lengths ahead someone running normal to you at 25m away.

2.5 The hit registration/player-to-player sync is pretty damn bad. This also segways into point 3. but you'll watch your little tracer rounds travel through people's helmets while they're standing still and get no hint of a successful hit, or you'll light someone up 15 feet in front of you and watch them turn into a red mist and they'll turn around and drop you in one or two shots. It's all just super sloppy feeling, like you're constantly gambling with bad servers and chinese players with 500 ping.

3. Horrendous servers. This is an issue that if anything has gotten worse since full release. The first 5 minutes or so of landing into the map is just rubber banding, waiting 5-15 seconds to collect things off of the ground, getting shot around corners that you turned several seconds prior, and some of the jankiest gunfights you will ever see in a $40 or whatever it costs nowadays game. You'll get shot around cover pretty consistently throughout the game, you'll watch your bullets phase through people running in a straight line, and there will be the occasional Corvo inspired blink man who can get from point A to point B by teleporting up stairs or around tight corners to instantly drop you because the servers can't be f***ed to keep up.
-quick sidenote here, my friend and I got really into duos for a stretch, and we won a lot, so these complaints are not coming from someone just salty about losing. We were pretty good, i'm just tired of putting up w/ these painful issues to keep playing this game.

4. The movement. I think it's the way the game manages player acceleration that makes it feel so bad, but it feels like you're constantly fighting the game to get your character to move how you want. Vaulting was definitely a necessary addition, and i think it was done pretty well, but oh man is the rest of the movement bad. A directional input from the player takes about a second or two for the character to get up to speed, and turning and jumping are directly tied to your current momentum, so it just feels like you have very little tight control of your character. Arma2 has better movement mechanics imo, and if you play Arma2, you know that says a lot.

[b] Now for things that are done well: [/b]

1. Battle Royale is fun. BR game modes are tense, exciting, and rewarding, and as much of a shame as it is, PUBG is really the only healthy BR game right now. 

2. Sound design. Using sound to hone in on players or gunshots is not hard w/ a decent soundscape, and gunshots sound good. The actual gun's blast, the bullet's snap, and the report are all usually distinguishable and they add to the experience. Sometimes suppressors can make guns completely inaudible over the snap or the report, but so be it. Also suppressed shots generally sound very good within audible range.

[b] TLDR [/b]

Compared to other battle royale games of the past: The Culling (in its first couple of combat iterations where it was genuinely a blast), H1Z1 (although it had its own slew of problems, it was fast paced, tight, and fun), and Arma3 BR (truly the peak of the BR genre IMO, but sadly arma is just not accessible enough to hold peoples' interest or collect a strong enough playerbase or audience), PUBG just doesn't meet some pretty easy standards of quality in my opinion, and i think people just don't know better than to just accept it for the only BR title to play and support atm. It's got some relatively bad network performance, only recently does it have decent clientside performance, it has inconsistent and frustrating gunplay, janky and loose movement that does not compliment a game of this style or intended pace, and it above all else just feels like it's going to be a forever Early Access title that was lost to a big publisher more interested in generating money and twitch/youtube stardom than developing a high quality game appreciated for anything more than the base concept of Battle Royale alone.",1515121501,1515121501,False,25,0,0.676089704036712646,7,True,False,False

It's definitely in a better place than it was early access, don't get me wrong, however all the little things that are still wrong with it add up and it results in a game that you can put up with for an hour or two rather than something you enjoy playing for hours on end. 

PUBG has also shown what Bluehole are like as a company and I won't be buying another one of their games - i.e. a plethora of issues with their product during early access; spend effort developing a paid crate system or spend effort filing law suits against other BR games or spend effort adding content, not fixing the existing content.

They shoud've concentrated in fixing bugs, not releasing new content that everybody disliked and just added new bugs to the game. They should've stop the chinese hackers. They should've tweaked the rules so watching the game would be enjoyable, not a campers' clash. They've milked the game and now is time to just abandon it. The gaming community gave the same chance that we gave to League of Legends, the thing is that Riot Games took the chance and made something noteworthy with it.

[h1]UPDATED REVIEW[/h1]

I am glad to say it is time to change my review.  Soon after writing my original review I started making a list of things PUBG needed to change or implement to be brilliant, many of those changes have been introduced I am very glad to say.

Here is my list of things PUBG needed to change;

== PRO ==
- The game idea is a great one and surviving in such circumstances gives great pleasure.
- Lots of weapons and combos available; could be more in the future.
- Graphically some aspects are pretty good (although weather is no longer active).
- single + Multiplayer action.
- Recently improved UI – About flipping time.

== CON ==
- The performance is shocking…watch the video above. (MOST SERIOUS OF ALL ISSUES).
- CHEATING AND HACKING  Oh look CAPS 
- MiCrO TrAnSaCtIoNs.
- Adjustments to weapon effectiveness in an attempt to force closer battles; terrible idea.
- Locations on Map look plonked, not realistic towns or places.
- Paid Keys to unlock crates for pointless add-ons. 
- KILL CAM had better be broken or else!

== OVERVIEW ==
Terrible experience mixed with an incredible addictive quality.

Without a decent development team who prioritise ethics, honour and respect for the communities that invested in the game, then this game will never be good quality.

Such a shame that something so good could end up being so bad.

That being said the addictive qualities often out way the negative qualities mentioned; this I think is why the devs are just trying to cash in on those addicted players now;  

Just do enough to entice people back in, the addiction starts again and as long as the stress, anger and annoyance of such a poorly optimised game is lesser than the addiction…money for nothing.

I do not recommend you buy this game at full price, not sure I recommend it at any price.  

It is addictive, there can be some wow moments but it will not enrich your life or make you feel good…it just wont.",1525774033,1566053426,False,27,2,0.674549400806427002,22,True,False,False

Sure it has 3 million players but I wonder how many are ACTUAL players because our wonderful hackers have multiple accounts to not only cover their shady practices but also ruin the community market by farming multiple crates, resulting in a crash of the whole PUBG economy.

So finally players like my friends and myself would not have to always leave the game when they randomly landed on a Miramar lobby. This can be a real pain when you are unlucky and you get thrown on Miramar multiple times in a row. Especially if you keep in mind that even if you start on Erangel you always have to wait for 60 seconds until the game starts. All in all you could have a waiting time of around 5 minutes before you finally start a game on your desired map. And if you are unlucky or unskilled it could already be over after a couple of seconds again and the whole process starts again. So ye we were really happy after the great news 'Map Selecion is implemented'. Today only a couple of weeks later they removed the map selection again. But why?

According to some interview footage I've found it is because of the queue waiting time of Miramar. They say it would be too long since it is so unpopular and players would not play it anymore. A logical conclusion to this would be to either remove the unloved Miramar or seperate the players so the small Miramar fan group could still meet up and play their map while the majority of players can enjoy Erangel or even the new map Sanhok. The developers however decided to go for a really ""smart move"". Why not force the majority of players to play a map which is unliked by most of them? Ye thats what they actually did! You can now choose between randomly landing on Miramar or Erangel again or/and pick the new map Sanhok. So again if you do not like Miramar but Erangel you have to leave the lobby over and over again. Great idea Blue Hole! Developers should definetely force players to play something they do not want to. That makes the experience great. 

So my friends and I decided to not play PUBG any longer until one day maybe map selection will be back. Until then lets keep spamming their update news commentary section again with the good old spam we used before map selection got implemented for the first time.

PUBG is fundamentally broken and hobbled. The game is quite seriously unplayable by any modern standard. The number of active players has been dropping like an anchor, and with many good reasons. [b]Do not buy this game.[/b] 

PUBG's devs have done nothing about any of the game's numerous issues except push out cash-grab cosmetics and quasi-gambling loot boxes, while doing the bare minimum to retain their cash-cow community's involvement without fixing any of PUBG's numerous issues. The devs do not care about the community, they are unable to keep their word, they don't care about the game running at a bare-minimum level of performance, and are either unable or unwilling to fix any of these issues, if not both. I personally have played essentially 200 hours, and this game is absolute garbage, run by a bumbling team of inept idiots who are seemingly incapable of doing anything right or even holding true to their word or their community. 


[u]To explain[/u]:
With top-of-the-line hardware, the game is unable to consistently maintain triple-digit frame rates or even hit them at all on the lowest settings. The game's performance is abysmal, and the devs who have had more than a year to fix the issues have offered nary a peep or solution apart from the empty ""we're looking into it"" message they feed the community. With each update, the game runs slower and choppier. With each update, the frame rates take more and more hits. 

The lag and desync are abysmal. The connectivity, even when playing on servers that are in one's region, is fraught with the likes of getting killed behind cover multiple seconds after shots are fired and a line of sight has been broken or players stuttering and lagging as they travel which makes killing or even landing shots impossible. Outright disconnection occurs frequently too. 

The devs, while PUBG was in early access, gave their word that no microtransactions would be added to the game until it left early access. They lied. They reneged on their word, and added paid lootboxes in August of 2017. They have continued to pump out cosmetic items since, all while plaintively bleating that these are done for the good of the game and the cosmetics team is different from the performance and development team. Yet the community sees no performance results from these lying devs, and continues to be exploited for profit. 

PUBG has refused to region-lock their game, which has led to an overwhelming influx of lagging and hacking players from less-developed countries who exploit the game's poor state of development for their own gain. Their vain attempts at integrating anti-cheat do nothing about the leaderboard infestation of hackers who dominate the top levels of the ranking system. Reporting them does nothing, and PUBG seems either unable or unwilling to do anything (i.e. they are either inept or malicious, if not both). These anti-cheat systems are also tied to the game's ever-decreasing performance from update to update, and yet masses of cheaters remain unaffected by the anti-cheat as evidenced by their clear prevalence in the game's leaderboards. 

As the final straw, PUBG's devs are so greedy and inane that they have disabled item trading and have even disabled selling of paid cosmetic items on the Steam market in some inept and myopic attempt to control the market in its entirety.",1528009519,1528009610,False,35,0,0.653976798057556152,10,True,False,False

-More serious and grittier alternative to Fortnite
-Potential for tactical and strategic gameplay
-Fairly polished gunfighting and hitboxes
-Warmode is fun I guess

Cons:
-Dev team focuses on negligible balancing issues rather than game-breaking bugs
-Is effectively the same game it was at the beginning of early access
-Horrific optimization means 60fps is unlikely on all but high-end rigs
-Often the server lags when many people are in a small area making crowded endgame fights unfair
-Minor updates (introducing new crates etc) are huge and require you to basically redownload most of the game again
-This means major updates are bigger than most games
-Cosmetic microtransactions on a £27 game? Seriously?
-Attempts to sue main rival, proceeds to leech successful systems like event pass for even more money
-Anti-cheat system is non-existent, in my experience there is at least one aimbot/wallhack in most games
-Dev team ban hundreds of thousands of hacked accounts in China, yet refuse to region lock servers when most hackers on EU have chinese or randomly generated names
-On the above point, this is probably because they can milk another £27 out of the players who've been banned from AS server for their new account
-Meh, seems that £700m+ is too little for this company

Overall I'd say it's an enjoyable experience to play and one of the better-funtioning games of its genre. Personally, I don't regret buying the game for £27 and playing it for 250+hours since early access. However, even considering its popularity PUBG is not worth buying for that price now. This game is not going anywhere in the future and the dev team's negligence will eventually cause players taking a break from the game not to come back to it unless something changes quickly.",1532202417,1532202417,False,20,2,0.653077185153961182,0,True,False,False

While I would say this is a good thing to happen, I will still leave this review up to be read as it was originally written. To quote JFK: ""Forgive your enemies, but never forget their names."" Same principle: While we can be happy that Bluehole has withdrawn the lawsuit, the fact that they have done this lawsuit in the first place (and other scummy practices in the past) means that people need to keep a watchful eye on Bluehole and PUBG so that this stuff doesn't happen again. I still stand by the things I've said here, and I hope this review will still highlight just how scummy Bluehole can be as a developer studio for those who were not around and/or aware of the lawsuit filed against Fortnite.

To say that this game is the worst of the battle royale games is a blatant lie. I will not deny that PUBG was the key contributor to bringing the battle royale genre to what it is today. The gameplay can range from boring and mundane walking through empty plains to heartpounding and sweat-inducing thrills. Comparing it to Fortnite would, in my opinion, be semi-pointless because both of them handle the gameplay very differently. In the end, it comes down to personal preference, and if you like PUBG, then the more power to you. I won't deny that the game is good, successful or how it changed some things in the game industry. So wait, if I'm saying the game is good, then why am I not recommending it? Because of the developers and their attitude towards any game developer who dares to utter the term ""battle royale"".

Bluehole has lost a lot of respect for me over the time I've had their game. With the addition of lootboxes before full release (not that adding them in was a good thing to begin with), lack of bug fixes and optimization, and a VERY inflated ego over the success of their game, Bluehole has shown very little incentive to actually make their game a more fun experience and instead focuses on taking out the competition by issuing lawsuit after lawsuit over incredibly petty issues, like having a frying pan (which Bluehole states is ""iconic to PUBG"" and apparently therefore cannot be used in any other game), weapons (PUBG bases their own weapons on real life weapons, yet they have the nerve to say they own this?) and a rubber chicken that had nothing to do with PUBG in the first place, but Bluehole then claimed that it was referring to their ""iconic"" Winner Winner Chicken Dinner victory statement (I don't think it even needs to be said, but I'm fairly certain they did not create this statement).

Then comes the Fortnite lawsuit. Remember when I said comparing PUBG to Fortnite would be semi-pointless? Well, Bluehole seems to disagree. There is no doubt that when Fortnite hit the scene, it did many of the things that PUBG did and improved on them, it was free, different and because of all that it took the world by storm. Epic Games themselves admitted that they were inspired by PUBG to make their own version in Fortnite, yet Bluehole seemed to have understood ""inspired by"" as ""we stole content from"", which is absolutely not the case. Now that Fortnite skyrocketed past PUBG, Bluehole is trying its best to bring it down, and for a game that's already as successful as PUBG, that is just sad.

I find it funny that Fortnite, possibly one of the most original looking battle royale games out there to date, is being accused of stealing content by developers of PUBG, which is known to have used stock assets. Nothing wrong with using premade assets and I will not fault Bluehole for doing it, especially since they're one of the few game devs who actually used premade assets properly. But I find it ironic that a game that has used assets not made by themselves is claiming copyright over a game that has made its own assets from scratch... and funnily enough, they're focusing their lawsuit on gameplay aspects more than anything... You know, basically for being in the battle royale genre.

Bluehole wants devs to enter the battle royale scene, but seem to be actively suing any major title creators who do it, and only because they don't want competition. If we were to go insert their logic as standard in the game industry, then platformer games would be owned by Nintendo, and games like Mega Man or LittleBigPlanet wouldn't exist. First Person Shooters would be owned by id Software, and Activision would have never made it big with Call of Duty. Bluehole seemed to be a big innovator, but now they seem like the antithesis of innovation.

For this reason, I do not want to recommend this game. If Bluehole wants to take out their drop in fame on other games more popular than theirs, then I don't think that they deserve your time or money. So again, the quality of the game is good enough to be enjoyable, but the attitude of the developers is something that we do not need in the game industry.

Also, if Bluehole actually got away with this lawsuit, it could set a very dangerous precedent where game devs would be able to sue others for just as petty things, and the game industry would be filled with nothing but false and frivolous lawsuits between companies, big or small.

The game also has been ported to Xbox One.

About the plot, 90-100 volunteers are sent to Erengel Island or Miramar region to take part in a massive Battle Royale (If you never heard of it this is a type of competition where all the contestants must kill each other and be the last survivor, this term was first used in japanese novel ""Battle Royale"" however it became popular when ""The Hunger Games"" were released.) and win a golden chicken... that's it. Kinda dissapointing because I was searching for some hidden history on those maps. Why these areas are abandoned? Is Battlegrounds legal? Who organise it and how did they got so many equipment and vehicles? You will not find anything like this, just some posters and graffiti promoting developers.
Every player can dispatch from a plane whenever he wants and land in any place of the map, some time after a safe zone will be set, you must find equipment and get there before time ends, if not your health will decrease. This zone however will become smaller with every 5 minutes, and if you will stay too long in one place you will be bombed, so wise use of multiple weapons, outfits, vehicles and consumables will give you a chance to survive. Sometimes luck is a decisive factor, you never know if someone is following you until you hear footsteps or be shot already. All the fun is about decisions and the risk. If you are smart you already noticed that you can just land near a boat and dive under it till safe zone is not forcing you to stop (first 20 guaranteed).
Optimalisation is still not perfect but it was improved since debut in early access, still to achieve 60 stable frames you need to play on lowest settings and textures are loading very long.
After every match we receive amount of battlecoins which can be spent on crates. You can open them and hope to get rare item or just sell it on steam market to buy other games (Recommended), 4 types are available, but they are completely random.

Steam will not let me to give it a mediocre rate so I am forced to give a negative note. 4,8/10. I admit that it is huge and still expanded, no pay2win or anything but it lacks anything that could keep me for longer, except selling crates but grinding will make you bored even faster. 

PS:If you are going to buy it, and I know you will because everyone are ignoring negative reviews of this game then you should catch those tips:
-Do not wear shoes because with them your footsteps are louder.
-Take frying pan everytime you see one, it can reflect up to 3 bullets which makes completely no sense at all.
-Using a vehicle is safest and fastest way to kill someone.
-First person view is much less safe than third person one.
-Shotgun range of fire is not limited like in other games so it is not worse than machine gun.
-Hide in high grass often.
-Loot drops are not worth the risk.
-If you are not brave, hide in water a lot.
-Learn to communicate if you are playing duo or team variant.
-Good use of your controls will make you land faster when you use parachute.",1517397992,1517397992,False,14,1,0.644805729389190674,5,True,False,False

Where to even begin. The gameplay is great and they've done that very well. When everything actually works this is one of my favorite titles. The problem is that everything really only works about 30% of the time you play.

Pros:

-Intense gameplay
-Competition
-Weapons are detailed and realistic from look to sound

Cons:

-NA servers are overrun with chinese
-NA servers are overrun with chinese hackers
-When they deploy a patch to fix something ten other things break
-Dev's don't seem to bother fixing the cheating epidemic (PUNKBUSTER IS GOD)
-Rampant crashes even on good systems
-Servers too busy try again later 50% of the time
-EX:HTTPREQUEST 30% of the time
-Vehicles, well just youtube some PUBG vehicle videos and you'll see


For the amount of money that these guys have made they sure don't seem to be willing to fork any over to pay for good anti-cheat or hire a full time professional set of developers to iron out all of the issues that are constantly present. 

If you enjoy being shot through walls from accross the map, if you enjoy some chinese internet cafe cheater being able to see you through walls then talk about how bad you are at the game, IF you enjoy not being able to connect when you want to play, or if you can connect be unable to invite your friends to the squad because 'REASONS', then this game might just be for you.

I would steer clear until the devs get their shit together and become willing to do soemthing about the major issues plaguing this game.

There were lootboxes at first. The lootboxes were not ideal, but they were free! Then the first paid box: the Gamescom Invitational. This was alright though because it was only one box, and the proceeds funded the tourney. That's fine!

That's where it started. Then it became the worst of the worst.

MICROTRANSACTIONS!

When you buy a lootbox with ingame currency, YOU DO NOT KNOW WHICH LOOT BOX YOU WILL GET! There are free crates and paid crates, which require keys for $2.50. There is 50/50 chance that the lootbox you buy with ingame currency will still require a KEY which goes for $2.50! YOU OPEN A LOOTBOX OF LOOTBOXES AND RNG DECIDES WHETHER OR NOT YOU GET TO EVEN OPEN THAT BOX FOR FREE!

Let's talk about the Battlepass! Bluehole charges people $10 for a for a pass to unlock challenges for cosmetics. These challenges last a few weeks. The common cosmetic unlocks are yours forever, but RARE COSMETICS UNLOCKED VIA BATTLEPASS ARE TIMED COSMETICS! YOU LOSE THEM WHEN YOUR PASS IS UP!

BLUEHOLE! YOUR GAME DOESN'T WORK. IT HAS BEEN OVER A YEAR AND YOUR GAME STILL RUNS WORSE THAN MY GRANDMA AFTER HER KIDNEY TRANSPLANT! 

Bluehole made a big ""FIX PUBG"" initiative where they laid out a roadmap for patches and optimization. Does this need to be explained in detail to see how repulsive this behavior is? Bluehole didn't care about performance until the review bombs started, and now the company tries to place itself as the ""PRO-CONSUMER GOOD NICE GUY"" for making patches when the issues the company is addressing should have been fixed well before the 1.0 launch.

NO CONTENT!

Content drops are few and far between. A new gun is added once per total solar eclipse and a new map is like seeing Halley's Comet in the night sky.

Bluehole drip-fed consumers bad content, made little to no effort to fix their game and instead pumped development resources into microtransaction and monitization strategies.

Please do not by this game until the developers Region lock it.  PUBG is an amazing game with a lot of potential; if you’re into First Person Shooters this game should be something you keep in mind. The issue with this game is it's community. Upon entering the game, you will have the ability to create a generic character, select your region (servers) and select from solo, duo or squad based combat. I have played on the North American and European servers, and in most of my solo games, they're have been hackers, some of which are untargetable, have augmented their capabilities or/and have Aim-bots that can shoot passed the fog of war. If you decide to play Duo or Squad base combat, you should either have a pre-made team OR know Mandarin. These are the only two ways you will be able to communicate with your team effectively. As most of the players in both the North American and European servers are Mandarin speakers from China. If the language barrier and  the hackers aren't an issue for your playstyle, prepared to be shot in the back or killed, by a teammate because you’re not Chinese and they (the other Chinese members of your team) want your loot, this will happen on a NORTH AMERICAN server. I comprehend/speak English, Spanish, French, some Italian and Portuguese, and this is the first time in my 26 years of gaming that I couldn't play a fun game due to language barrier.",1515049766,1515049766,False,13,2,0.630370676517486572,2,True,False,False

This is an average shooter at best, but everyone plays it so it looks better than it really is.
All of my friends are blinded by nostalgia for the game and they refuse to accept that the game itself is dying.

Things to take into consideration before buying the game.

#1 They only release cash grab content.  (IE: Crates of cosmetics that cost an additional $2.50 to open, even after hours of hardwork and grinding to even get a crate with ingame currency, and now this Sanhok Event Pass which dont even get me started, they have TIMED cosmetics given to you. are you fucking for real? i earn a item in game that goes away regardless of buying your stupid pass?)

#2 the Netcode ala server stability. so many times have i died to rubber banding or ""network error detected"" For a company who advertises how popular the game is how much money they make etc etc. they dont spend a dime on improving the games servers or netcode to modern standards. 

#3 Hackers, not as prevalent now as it used to be when they opened the gates to chinese playerbases, but the fact remains they do very litle in managing cheating prevention. sure we have battle eye, but battle eye sucks and everyone knows it, i used to script hack Arma 2 DAYZ all the time with just one program (CE) and im just an amateur cheater.  I dont care how much they advertise cheat prevention, its way too easy to get around.

i could go on for more bullet points but this should suffice, the game is good at best and is worht 30 dollars to play it, i do not however recommend you ever buy keys for crates. if you do play the game only sell your stupid crates for 3 cents on steam market and be done with it.",1529513720,1529513720,False,42,1,0.629408597946166992,0,True,False,False

If you sure you want this game, let me teach you a little Chinese, it may save your life in the game.

1.Chinese players talk loudly, and will shout ""syon di"" or ""syon de"" to you. They are trying to know if you are Chinese. 
   You'd  better say the same word to them, or they will kill you when you get a lot of items.
2.You may meet some Chinese players always say ""tso"" or ""nima"", they may kill you however you can speak Chinese. 
   Keep away from them please.
3.To most Chinese players, they won't kill you if you just shout ""CHINA NUMBA WAN!"", 
4.Chinese players who always talk are noobs. Solo is better than trying to take a team work with them.

- Cashing in your earned BP now supplies you with locked crates which can only be opened by purchasing keys. Why not make paid crates exactly that. Paid. 

Why take normal unpaid crates away from regular players, trying to force/guilt players into buying a key to unlock what is essentially useless crates in their inventory. Almost as bad as gambling. What a great incentive to pave children into a life of gambling and forking out their hard earned pocket money just to make a quick buck.

[*] Unoptimised game of the decade
[*] Cheaters still rule the game
[*] Requires a top end PC to run at stable 60 fps
[*] Absolutely crap netcode
[*] Wonky and terrible animations
[*] Severe microstutters outta nowhere
[*] ""Network Lag Detected""
[*] Total crap 17 Hz servers that may die any sec
[*] Every major patch they release screws up the game even moar
[*] Ridiculous vehicle with beyblade physics and controls
[*] Occasionaly game will be stuck on loading screen
[*] Random connection timeouts
[*] Constant invariable frame rates
[*] CTDs 20% of the time
[*] Still rubberbands (door puzzle)
[*] Asset flips
[*] CPU killer
[*] Chinese everywhere =_=
[*] Killcam and spectate is not accurate
[*] Bullet hit angle inconsistencies, o boi
[*] Fecked up FPP aim when near walls or windows
[*] Moar players near = Moar lag (imagine 10~20 alive in finale circle lool)
[*] Camera jerks like hell when in passenger seat, can't aim or heal up
[*] Dat horrible lag when someone shoots/ when I shoot and after landing on the ground
[*] Cannot rejoin a custom match if disconnected/crashed, lost a tournament due to that
[*] Depth of Field when ADS is cancer, can edit config file but you will get BANNED -_-
[*] Red zone explosion sound = Ear raype
[*] 25 MB update every 5 hours (srsly?) with no changes
[*] More investment in useless crates and skins than actually fixing the mess they made
[*] A DLC now eh? pls

Graphics are so terrible that it looks like huge pile of junk created back in 2000. Gobbles up my 2GB VRAM and 4+ gigs of RAM even on lowest textures and settings. On top of that, to even struggle for fps is just pathetic. All of this even in the so called final release v1.0 #Update 7, I can't even imagine how it used to be in Early Access as people say ""It got better"" _/\_

It's powered by the famous Unreal Engine that made beautiful games like Bioshock Infinite, Paragon, ABZU, feck even Fortnite, an another Battle Royale game which used to be in the same boat as PUBG in terms of optimisation on start, now I can run it on epic settings 60fps @ 1080p without any hitches. 

Dunno why the whole world is praising this game and they say it's ""Esports ready"" for this unplayable garbage. All those people yelling ""A perfect example for Early Access"" shut it please. It's super far from being a full game. You need a beastly PC to fully enjoy the game in it's merciless glory of Lagginggrounds, it still does lags a bit on top end rigs too though.

But despite all these problems it's fun playing the game, if all these problems were fixed then it's probably the best game ever made, but I don't have any hopes though cuz we are talking about

The game idea behind it and the way its been implemented. That being said I can't recommend it to any of my local friends due to the fact that there aren't any servers hosted on my continent (Africa) or my country (RSA). You can't compete against players in a critical shooter when everyone your playing against is 200ms ahead of you. It noticable everywhere, from the parachute landing, to picking items up, to being in a fist fight, to getting whacked by a pistol when unloading 7.62 rounds at an enemy (Of course my skill might be an issue there). To the death cam which always shows a delay in aiming which I can pretty much see is 200ms behind.

Price is fair but I wouldn't mind paying a bit more so that you can remove the micro-trancations that was just introduced recently. I mean you sold a butt load of the game which should be enough to cover all expenses. And now making all that extra with the micro-transactions you still can't host here. A clan member offered to host it for free (In Gauteng) even and got a reply saying there is to little demand. I mean you broke sales records ffs!

I will still play the game of course (Seeing as I did buy it). Gonna try and make my money back by trying to sell the items I got in loot cases before you starting charging people to open them.

Since the game was released and was in early access i was fine with how tha game may not function correctly. Played over 200hrs and the only major problem was the desync, which is to be expected while the game is pretty much being funded and developed at the same time. After the 200hrs the game became a almost unbearable to play. It had desync and some other bugs which were very ground breaking. The game breaking glitches were worked on and were getting fixed. 250hrs in and guess what... HACKERS. While its to be expected, the hackers ruined the gameplay, not just for me, but for 90% of the player base. A month or two down the line the develepors and Battle eye began to work on stopping hackers as much as they could, however they still havent finished. Now, since the desert update, there have been not only hackers but still some ground breaking bugs and STILL! desync. The desync should have been fixed before the game came out of early access, but it still hasent been fixed. The fact this game is now out of early access and still has some bugs that can insta kill you is awfull. So the day im writing this review, the game crashed, i came back to the game and was invisivle to my team mate. i could interact with everything but could kill anyone or even move on the server.

Now that ive explained my experience and views, i should note, if these issues were to be fixed, the game would continue to climb to the most played game and may even be ""the best game"" but the MUST fix desync for a starters.

Are you guys trying to imitate EA? What are you going to release next? DLC for PUBG?

Full released game? 
I can see this game probably going to be F2P... just like H1Z1. This game is full of bugs and hackers. I am thankful for devs for fixing this but sometimes fixing it making it more broken.

Region-lock?
They say ""there is no reason to region lock."" - 2017
Why Now? When most streamers moved to Fortnite or other games, they are trying to clickbait the players again with this bullshit. 

They promised us custom server but where is it? 
Only available for Youtuber/Twitch streamer with 50,000 subs / 150 concurrent views. 
But how did some people with no-name or whatsoever can have their own custom server? Take a look at the Custom Match list. They're not even streamer and mostly unknown people who hosted the server, how did they get the server? Some hacker clans (if you play long enough you know the hacker clans) have their own custom server????

PUBG Support is really useless.
I contacted PUBG Support and reported players hacking with A CLEAR VIDEO OF EVIDENCE (snake hack/instant heal/aimbot...etc-etc)... The next day I play, it's the same players AGAIN.
Contacted them and guess what... ""WE DID NOT TAKE ACTION AGAINST THIS PLAYER...WAITING FOR A NUMBER OF REPORTS TO...""
waiting for numbers of reports? 
What a waste of time trying to talk to them.

The game used to be good... Very good. I really or...used to love the game.
I'm very dissapointed of what it has become.

Until they enforce a strong anti-hack/VAC ban or whatsoever measure to fight the hackers and fix the game, I might change the review...

I've played this game extensively on xbox1 but cannot find a fucking match without cheaters on steam.

Todays version however I can't even call it fun. The game feels more broken than when it first started. Nearing the release of their second map and the Vaulting / climbing ability update the game just stopped making progress at all.

They instead spent most their time making loot boxes and then adding another map later down the line instead of fixing problems that already existed in the game ontop of that hackers/cheaters became more and more of a problem until it reached the point you will encounter 1 or 2 hackers every 8 of 10 games you may play.

It became clear with more and more lootboxes being worked on and some being aimed at streamers plus then sueing another company for copying them when the concept of battle royal isn't original to Bluehole/PUBGCorp, all they truely care about is money. Not what the community wants or probably even wanting to make this game good either.

To really add to their already ruined reputation they added a £7.49  ($9.94) Event pass for the upcoming Sanhok map which comes with Premuim loot. ""We get premuim loot?"" Oh... well don't get too excited because it's not yours to keep, there's an expiration timer once you open the items. The map itself is not exclusive either. It will be released to all players at an unstated date so you'il technically have paid for absolutely nothing.

If you really think about it the structure they now have in place is basically that of a free to play game and I can think of far better free to play games to play than this game.

Do yourself a very big favor and don't buy this game and if you're already unfortunate enough to own it, don't buy the event pass or any DLC they may bring out.

However, I'm writing this review because there has been issues with higher ping players ruining the experience of PUBG for other players (mostly players in Asia ruining it for the rest of the world), and I've seen firsthand through deathcams that my killer not only doesn't hit me with hardly any of his shots, he even misses shooting allies, yet still somehow kills them.

My issue with this personally is that the developer, Brendan Greene, has come out and defended players exploiting this, saying and I quote: ""They love the game. Why would we restrict them from playing on servers? I just don't get the attitude of some people."" Proof: http://www.pcgamer.com/pubg-players-respond-to-bp-apology-with-demand-for-chinese-region-lock-over-cheating/

Why is this a problem you ask? Because there isn't anything being done against anyone that exploits higher ping; PUBG has sold more copies in China than in the US alone. Why not? If you can openly cheat, and have the developer back you up, why not take advantage of the situation? The problem with this is, this ""fanbase"" of his is only temporary. His dedicated fanbase is people who play in their own region, with their own decent ping, and enjoying it. (AKA, the rest of the freaking world) He is spitting in their faces by defending people that intentionally exploit high ping to gain an unfair advantage, and I find it sickening he is doing it without regret.

As it stands, I cannot recommend PUBG to anyone except people with masochistic personalities that enjoy the idea of players on the other side of the world beating them with invincibility and network lag in their favor. Until the developer wises up and stops catering to only one set of people, I will inform any potential buyer that he doesn't care about them enjoying the game, so long as he gets his money in the end. I hope others will join me in this effort to show him that he can't bully people into accepting his twisted line of thinking in which cheating is acceptable.

A game I want to like. Love even, but simply can't due to the company putting their (dickhuge) bottom line before their actual product.

PUBG saw explosive growth thanks to the free advertisement of YT Creators and Twitch popularity. It hooked everyone into the Last Man(Team) Standing game mode and popularized a game mode by taking inspiration from the games that predated it and refined it into something that should've been a masterpiece. The game was good fun, good combat mechanics, and created some very tense Guadalajaran stand-offs that could pump you full of adrenaline, especially on your way to your first Chicken Dinner.

Unfortunately, the developer has made some very questionable decisions when it comes to the game's longevity and that explosive growth has since started to moderately evaporate.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
[b]1. Combat, Weaponry and Sound[/b]

- In any shooter, satisfying gunplay is key. PUBG aces this. Weapons feel and sound great to shoot, sound of nearby and distant gunshots keep you alert and aware of all the action occuring within your oscillatory environment, aiming is handled very well in both TP and FP with an added touch of steadier aiming when holding your breath. Subtle nuances like this make landing those 1000m kills on the person(s) or squad who's collecting their spoils of war from their own skirmish very satisfying. The options for rebinding and sensitivity for every aiming mode further allows for fine tuning.
 
- Good sound design is something I heavily adore and the gun sounds are very distinct; you will know what weapon your opponent is trying to take you out with. This can allow you to auditorily size up your enemy to know what exactly you're going up against and allow you to determine if you have the means to engage. Vehicle sounds underwent a change, in my opinion, for the better, as they don't sound as grating and flat like they used to before and, like weapons, have their own distinct sounds that allow you to know what's about to [strike]run you over[/strike] pass you by. The mortar strike sound update was majorly improved and you are now fully able to get in your last will and testament when you hear that whistling sound stop briefly before you are no more.

- Weapons are modifiable and had a good update that now allows them to be even more modular for anyone who wanted weapons to be affected according to any given situation. I'm the guy who just grabbed a 4x, vert grip, ext quickie and compensator for his M4 but that extra viability in weapon assortment is always a plus for anyone who wants to suit an engagement to their terms.

For a game that heavily uses store-bought assets (which I'm not against if it's done reasonably well as it is in PUBG), it forms a good, cohesive foundation for a game that had the opportunity to take the gaming market with an iron fist. Of course, [b][i]Had[/i][/b] being past-tense, I feel that opportunity is long gone for some of the most obvious reasons and very bad internal prioritizing obligations from Bluehole that have allowed games like Fortnite to eclipse PUBG in this game mode that is now being gangbanged by indie and AAA developers alike to get a slice of this pie that was so ready to be wholly claimed by Bluehole.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
[b]2. Performance[/b]

- Early access of PUBG was in March 2017 and was released in a very poor and unstable build. Optimization resulted in many of whom I know, and from the EA reviews at the time, playing on the lowest settings to maximize framerate. Stability and optimization, bug fixes and general QoL improved over time, but it was at a snail's pace and some patches left more to be desired. With the worldwide release in December 2017, the game was still in a relatively bad state deemed to be an official release, although general improvements had been made and the game was, for the most part, playable for mid-range PCs without much stuttering and audio cutting. 5 months after release (which was about when I stopped playing) the game's performance still suffers from stuttering, minimal audio cutting and should in no way be released officially. 

Putting aside the networking infrastructure, as that seems to be the hurdle for every battle royale game for the moment, the state of the game is playable but not optimal unless you have a high-end or enthusiast PC, but based on user feedback for PUBG, the instability of the game doesn't seem to guarantee 100% performance. With the graphical aesthetics of the game, mid-ranges should be loading this game no problem.

[b]3. Bugs[/b]

- Will not lie, some of the bugs in this game are for the better; ridiculous collision physics launching cars, bikes, and humans many kilometers to their impending doom will never get old in video games. However, a lot of these bugs had serious impact on gameplay (the off-track aiming bug, parachute rebounding you in the air and clipping on weird things that can lead to a lot of health lost on landing or, worse, death, low performance players abusing texture rendering -- allowing them to walk, see and shoot through buildings, the list goes on.) Many of the gamebreakers got an eventual patch but some were few and far between and the wait was real for things that could've been bumped as simple hotfixes. Can't comment on the state of the game today since it's been a while since I last played, but from what I remember, the bugs, in my experience, were minimal in terms of affecting gameplay.

[h1][strike]The Ugly[/strike][/h1]
[b]4. Hackers[/b]

- PUBG was plagued FAR too long with hackers that really killed morale for me and my friends playing at all for quite a while, which I can only assume affected a good portion of the playerbase the same as us. They were subtle briefly, then came the half-map MLG Tony Hawk 900 no scopes with fucking buckshot. Your PUBG day comes to an abrupt end when you're in an apartment looting, hear a UAZ rolling by and you and your duo are sprayed dead by an UMP from that UAZ that's outside with absolutely no bullet penetration on walls. It started with maybe once every 5 games, then every 3, every other game, and on some days they were in every game myself or me and friends attempted to play. 

We've won chicken dinners against a few and there was no feeling of accomplishment to know that if we so much as exposed a hairline, we'd get fucking clipped. Last I saw, there were still some togglers out there who'd rack up 3 squads worth of wipes near the end of games, so that may or may not have changed now. I never cared for rank in most games I play but me and my duo made it to top 6% a couple instances but I never researched if the hackers were more prone to the higher or lower levels of rank. I should also note that we are filthy casuals and mostly played TPP so that may influence a lot.

[b]5. Bluehole's Bottom Line[/b]

- I don't care about games including lootboxes that lets people play dress-up, but Bluehole should've probably spent more of that $700m they made in revenue to reinvenst in their game before rushing their release and introducing more monetization. Whatever argument anyone could give does not excuse the poor state of the game on its launch and the writing was on the wall about the priority for the game. The improvements were not steady enough to begin with and the extra revenue they generated from its inclusion didn't seem to motivate them either. As such, with the negative experiences in gameplay starting to get more and more frustrating, I decided to part ways with an otherwise fun game. 

While not inherently ugly, other personal annoyances included:

- The exclusion of players hosting their own dedicated servers, only being provided to fuck knows who.
- A terrible HTML lobby system that occasionally makes starting a game a hassle.

But it does say something when the choices by a developer manage to ruin a game to such an extent that a fundamentally pleasant gameplay experience can be soured. 

I've seen complaints about lootboxes. I've seen pro- and con arguments. A lot of people talk about supporting the developer. But to me the idea that they would introduce both lootboxes behind a paywall in conjunction with a pass they've obvioulsy ripped off Fortnite seems downright greedy. Not only has the game not been optimised sufficiently since early Alpha, they have the guts to ask for more money from people who have ALREADY PAID FOR THE GAME. 

This is no longer 'supporting your developer'. In the recent sale PUBG was again a top seller. At this point it has become a cash grab. The fact that we've had fun, and can still have fun, seems like an accident at this point. The only reason to play now is the naive assumption that we are all weathering a bug ridden mess untill ""they finally fix the early access game it is"". Except that it isn't early access. It is a full release. More time goes into the main menu now than the engine. The engine is probably so broken by this point that they can't even fix it without a major overhaul.

My final verdict is very mixed, but nonetheless, I'll try to make this a good, and full, review.

[h1]So, an overview.[/h1] 
(For those who don't really know what PUBG is)

PUBG is a battle-royal-styled shooter, where (at most) one hundred players are pitted against one another to be the last man (or team, if you're one of those weird people that have friends) standing. You parachute from a plane, land where you want, and then loot what you can to protect yourself from other players. Okay, simple enough. The game has several guns, giving you some choice for how you'd like to play; everything from an over-under double barrel to a L115 rifle are available Classics like the AKM, M16, and even a trench shotgun are up for grabs; so the game’s got fun guns, all of which are nicely balanced. As of writing this, two maps are available to be fought on: Erangal and Miramar. Erengal is a lush, green-filled map with forests, a few plains, and rolling hills—all surrounded by an ocean. Miramar is an arid desert-y map with rather treacherous terrain and large cities, being quite a playground for snipers as I’ve come to learn. Both the maps are perfected with tons of detail, giving you a true feeling of stalking through an abandoned city, knowing you could get shot from any building you pass by.

Alright, so now that you know what PUBG is, time to talk about what makes it extremely fun in my eyes—and likely many others. 

[h1]First off, the guns.[/h1]

The firearms in this game are all satisfying to use, have plenty of recoil, and sound pretty realistic. Bolt-action rifles have a wonderful CRACK! to their sound, the automatic rifles and SMGs sound threatening and punchy, and the LMGs sound formidable. While it’s no Battlefield 1 sound design, it is definitely nothing to laugh at, and is actually very impressive compared to many other games of a similar caliber. 

[h1]Second off, the looks.[/h1]

The game looks very pretty, and—at least on my screen—has little graphical breaks. I have a GTX 1050 Ti, and while it’s no Titan or some crap, it’s pretty powerful and serviceable, and allows the game to run a smooth 60 frames or more if I sacrifice the quality of shadows; which I don't even notice much loss in terms of quality. The textures are phenomenal, the foliage is well detailed, and the animations are very well made and flowing—though, the bolt action rifles look a bit stiff in third person, but it’s not like you’ll be firing without looking through your scope. 

[h1]Third, the gameplay.[/h1]

The raw gameplay itself is two things: thrilling, and satisfying. Personally, I find this game is most enjoyable when you put yourself into your gameplay… truly immersing yourself into the atmosphere of being hunted from God knows where, and even hunting people yourself. The thrill of surviving and fighting, outsmarting your enemies, flying by a town on a motorcycle while a rain of lead trails behind you… all those edge-of-your-seat moments are what I keep coming back for. While I have only won a game once on my own and once with my boyfriend, I find winning is just a nice bonus on top of the firefights and satisfying kills you rack up by the time you meet your fate, or take the head of your last victim. But, even if you’re just here to screw around with your buddies, or screw around on your own, PUBG is great for those, and is even encouraged to be played that way.

Alright… now that I’ve praised this game, let me tell you why I wouldn't recommend buying it… ironic despite what I told you, but please, be patient.

[h1]First off, the launch.[/h1]

Oh my Lord, it was a mess—and is still very much a mess. Servers crashing, bandwidth being stretched to its limits, the game lagging or not even loading for people when they join a game… if you weren't told this is a release, you’d think this is still a very good-looking Alpha version. I, and many, MANY others, believe that the team behind PUBG was far too impatient, or rushed, or whatever, and the game has an obscene amount of bugs; too many of those bugs are game-breaking.

[h1]Second off, the player-base.[/h1] 

This is mixed, as there are tons of cool YouTubers making small fame off this game, plenty of funny people in lobbies, and some lobbies that are nothing but silence—which is music to some people’s ears. HOWEVER. There are also a lot of people who just yell or scream, play terrible music at ear-piercing volumes, or connect to different geographical regions just to annoy the Hell out of people (a lot of North American and European players seem to be complaining about floods of Asian players who are just trolling, or abusing their high-latency—which brings me to my next point).

[h1]Finally, the netcode.[/h1]

Simply: it's awful. I’m talking launch-of-Battlefield-4 awful. If a guy’s in close range or sitting still and you’re a fine shot, you shouldn't have many problems—the issues are in actual firefights, where you shoot at someone, they notice, and return fire. While at times, the netcode won't shove a hot Kalashnikov barrel up your butt, but if someone’s either using their high ping to their advantage, or you get an unlucky streak, a bullet may just somehow collide with your face and you won't even have a second to react. While, yes, I understand people can get lucky and just happen to put their sights right on your noggin, it’s a little… stretched at times. The death cams aren't the most accurate in terms of replaying exact mouse-movements, and are really just for uncovering obvious hackers. The bugs sometimes it seems a bit obscene, and often you will find you’ve been shot despite being behind cover. 


So, with ALL that being said, let me make my point. This game has plenty of awesome potential, and is a blast when it actually works as planned. The crew behind the game has acknowledged their mistake in it’s hasty release and has been working since day 1 to fix the issues (the situation has seemed to improve, but, this is bound to change). At the very least, it’s admirable these guys are attempting to fix the many issues plaguing the game, but all in all, I think it’s still too unstable to be considered a safe purchase—thirty USD can be a bit hefty for some people, and for a game that may or may not function properly, it’s especially risky. 


[h1]Finally verdict![/h1]

This game, by itself in core values, is a fantastic game. Thrilling, satisfying, and most importantly, fun, PUBG is a great title… but now, because of the bogged performance for many people and hasty release, I don't think it’s too sound of a purchase. If you have faith in your PC and internet connection, then maybe go ahead and give it a try. 

And, if you read all that, then good on you for caring about your game purchases, and be sure to check back as the game is continued to be updated and patched: hopefully it’ll become all it should be, and perhaps, even more.",1515703436,1515703774,False,5,0,0.601449251174926758,0,True,False,False

[b]The gameplay[/b]:

You start playing and wait a minute untill the game starts. Than a plane is crossing a map and you choose when to go down. As there are up to 100 players you need to choose your start area carefully. 
If you choose the wrong area (a hotspot with a lot of weapons), you might die immidiately without finding a weapon. Yes there is a option to clear a spot. If you do so, you feel very cool. But this is even for good players just working out sometimes. So expect at least three bad games for one cleared area.
The other option is to go somewhere into nowhere. You will run around and search weapons. Mostly finding crap. You do this for 5-10minutes. Sometimes you will get killed why doing this from your back. If you are a guy who loves collecting crap, this is probably the best way to play this game. I think this just suck. Running around and searching crap for up to 10 minutes is just bulls**t for me.
Lets suppose you finished this and you are still living. You need to move always to be in the living zone. An intelligent way to move is helping you to pass to the endgame. This kind of gameplay is really okay.
At the end everybody is camping somewhere as long as possible. If you want to win you need to hide and save your armor and helmet for the very last endgame. If you don't do this your position will be known by the enemys around you. If you are in the endgame you might get a higher pulse, because you spend so much time and so many f***ed up games into getting there. This is really cool at the beginning.
Getting a win over a lot of other players makes you feel very cool and strong.

[b]Problems:[/b]
[list]
[*] Cheaters: Especially if you manage to get further into the game, you will meet cheaters very often. This is simple mathematic. You play with 99 other guys. The chance that one of these is hacking is very high. The further a game is in progress you will meet exactly this cheater, because the cheater is going to win. This really sucks so hard. Getting a game destroyed by a cheater, where you managed to pass the first part of the game, is ridiculous. There are all kind of hacks possible. Speedhack, ESP/ Wallhack, Aimhack/Aimassitance.
Some people say that the cheaters are always Chinese guys playing on servers everywhere in the world. This is in my opinion wrong. Everywhere in the world are cheaters. Some guys just try to find culprits.
[*] Server-Performance: Was really bad before the game gets released. Now it is acceptable.
[*] Client-Performance: The requirements are high. Don't suppose to hide in the grass to early. The grass might not be rendered for your enemies and you are an easy target.
[*] Engine: The engine is not good for the game. There are so many bugs. Test for example the collision. The models seems to be just a box. The moving is akward.
[*] Very bad map design in my opinion. A lot of stuff in the map is just buyed at the market place.
[*] One gamemod and nothing to customize. You can't even choose the map you want to play.
[*] Skillbased matchmaking: It is not working out. I know that there are news about PUBG having one. But honestly this one feels not working correctly. What they did: They stopped showing the rank of the guy who killed you. So now, there couldn't be real evidence that this is not working.
 Maybe there is a very bad skillbased matchmaking.[/list]

However this game is probably the most successful online game ever. There are so many fanboys out, who love this game more than anything else. That's why I would say, you should test this game, if you have too much time and you are searching for an alternative to your main game. Especially if you are loving to run around and collect stuff, this Shooter is the right thing for you.

For me all the gamesessions in the past weeks, ended in hating this game. It honestly was a waste of time. I don't like collecting stuff. I hate the RNG in this game. I hate the engine problems. I don't like the map. I cannot accept that a company with so big open cashflow still don't give us the possibility to customize the games. But maybe you are another kind of gamer. So if you have time and money test this game.

I am suggesting to play CS:GO, if you search for a new multiplayer shooter. Yes there are also cheaters. But the chance of having a cheater belong 5 opponents is way lower than having a cheater belong 99 opponents. Also CS:GO is providing many more gamemodes. It is customable. There is way less RNG. The beginning is hard, but it's worth all effort.

Crashing minimum every 3 games is now the norm, a MASSIVE decrease in stability from previous so called ""beta/pre-release"" versions. What kind of studio releases a game that's less stable than the alpha and calls it job done?

Blueballs Interior Design has no idea how to make a real game, the studio is a joke and brings nothing but shame to their names, I'll explain even further why below.

Chinese Cheaters run rife in this sloppily coded mod they pretend is a standalone game, and they always will. The state of the game is all the indication that anybody needs that the Dev Team are monkeys pulling levers and pressing buttons. They have no idea what they are doing, where they are going and the monkey is charge is always doing a 'con or interview. As such the game is a hodgepodge of sloppy fixes and rushed additions, leaving a million holes for cheaters to exploit. As time goes by the cheaters won't reduce, they will only get better. More powerful exploits will be found in the swiss cheese code, maybe the most exciting thing about the game is seeing what the (actually talented, unlike the devs) cheat creators come up with in the future.

Every game session is marred by multiple bugs, horrendous rubber banding for the first few minutes, glitchy physics on players and vehicles, non-existent footsteps and ghost footsteps are now commonplace. Bullets pass right through enemies at range, or get stopped by invisible rocks and other objects since objects are now culled in the name of FPS but at the expense of gameplay. Smokes are often invisible to one or more members of my squad. I'll throw three and see only two, how often enemies mustn't see them. Practically every aspect of the game is buggy, the vehicles cannot go up steep hills because the AI constantly shifts gears, killing all speed. The VW Combi clone will stop dead on the unsmoothed, computer generated terrain that has bumps and jutting angles left over from world generation. The system demands you rejoin solo games you've already died in EVERY TIME you load the lobby, but will often refuse to allow you to rejoin squad and duo games in progress after your nth ""app module"" crash of the day. In the name of FPS enemy players are now culled the INSTANT they leave your sight, which when combined with the 10-15 tickrate of the game results in constantly teleporting enemies. Enemy ran behind a tree briefly? expect a 5m teleport when they exit the other side as your client tries to play catchup.

A very simple to use exploit that will likely never be fixed is to have one dead squad member, split one live member 1km+ away from the remaining two, the spectator can now switch between remaining members and will see no buildings after each switch for as long as their computer permits, until assets load. Players of course are perfectly visible inside the invisible buildings. 

The UI, recently upgraded for release is prettier and more useless in every way, friendly markers are larger than 20 bedroom buildings on the tiny, unzoomable minimap. There is now two blue markers in every squad, clearly no consideration goes into decisions like this.

I expect we'll soon see Brendan ""Tom"" Greene leaving the now monolithic ""PUBG CORP"" in order to chase his dream of finally creating a decent Battle Royale game, whenever that time comes, PUBG will still be unfinished, buggy, exploitable and filled with cheaters.",1514016522,1514024582,False,50,4,0.599967598915100098,5,True,False,False

There is no need to think in this game, only 1 thing that you have to do - find a gun and kill. Hmm cool. Really interesting. Ah wait, to do your gun a bit sexy, just spend mom's money and buy the skin, all is good. 

So, the ""game"" is pointless. All updates = ""Give us money, you, poor shit"". ""We don't care about optimization and bugs, just pay""

ESport's Scene sucks a lot. Just think, Esports in game where all is a random. Who 1st takes gun - has 95% to kill most of opponents in 1 zone. MMM cool, nice. Loot is a random shit as the game is.

So for sure there can't be an ESport.

I honestly have no clue where to start with this game so I'll just start off with the pros, as unfortunately the cons heavily outweigh them.

[h1] PROS [/h1]

[b] General Concept [/b]
For being one of the first of its kind PUBG's battle royale concept is a great one. For anyone who loved classic deathmatch games, the battle royale mechanics in PUBG provide an extremely enjoyable experience; Every moment is intense, multitasking is crucial, and stacking up your kills is always your primary goal. With 100 players fighting in a constantly shrinking area, the game provides intense, adrenaline fueled gameplay which can be entertaining for hours.

[b] Graphics [/b]
The realistic graphics in PUBG are great and look beautiful, while also providing the player with a great sense of immersion. There is a relatively good amount of detail that again makes the game all the more immersive. Even though today the game's graphics are a bit demanding the Bluehole team has made them more compatible throughout the game's development, and continue to do so.

[b] Online [/b]
PUBG is a big enough game that finding and joining a game is a quick process. The game's connectivity issues have been smoothed out overtime and as long as you have a ping under 100, online play is crisp and delay free.

I wish I had more positive notes to give, but unfortunately this is where we talk about the issues with the game. 

[h1] CONS [/h1]

[b] Gameplay [/b]
Even though the concept of PUBG is a great one as previously mentioned, the gameplay is disappointing to say the least and does not at all live up to the greatness of the game's concept. The gameplay heavily relies on RNG (Random Number Generator) systems and thus lacks in consistency, making the game itself more based off of a player's luck as opposed to a player's skill. The game also has an astronomically large amount of bugs and glitches that can chip away heavily at gameplay experience. Pair these two major issues together and you get a game that is almost the equivalent of a rigged slot machine.

[b] Playerbase [/b]
PUBG's playerbase is a bit of an iffy subject. While playing with other players in Duos and Squads can generally be a pleasant experience, there are times when you will be grouped with players who do not communicate, either because they don't intend to or because they literally can't due to language barriers. Apart from that the game still suffers from a large amount of hackers, and even though Bluehole is trying at getting rid of them they still diminish gameplay experience for many users who encounter them.

[b] Developer Incompetence [/b]
I honestly don't know where to start with this one. While PUBG originally started out as a promising multiplayer battle royale game, PLAYERUNKNOWN and Bluehole have managed to pull off a complete 180 and screw up anything that made the game enjoyable in the first place.  Ever since Fortnite took the podium as the 1# battle royale game, Bluehole and PLAYERUNKNOWN have became extremely bitter towards Epic Games and every other battle royale game currently on the market. While the game started out with the developers trying to be creative and add new features while also improving the game's quality, they now spend less time improving and creating and more time trying to figure out how to make more money. Since the game's popularity has been falling they've been trying to claw their way back into the spotlight by hosting Esports events and sponsoring internet celebrities. And through all of this mess they decided to stop listening to their community, the people that actually gave them the success they currently have. As of now they see their community as drones that will freely hand over as much money as they can leech out of them. Until they get their act together and straighten out their priorities, I can't recommend buying PUBG, or any game that either PLAYERUNKNOWN or Bluehole publishes for that matter.

[h1] Closing [/h1]
While PUBG may be a thrilling and fun game to play, I can't honestly recommend it because it simply isn't worth the money or the time. While one may get a somewhat enjoyable experience out of it, it's various flaws, inconsistencies, and developer immaturity make the game frankly, not worth investing in.

Secondly, this game is the biggest cash grab to date. The game just left early access and has been ported to Xbox One WITHOUT EVEN BEING OPTIMIZED.

I either have two choices, play with players that can zoom across the map, shoot across the map through walls and grounds, basically, a cheater infested mess(as of the recent update, they're implementing more anti-cheat measures, a good step, recovery takes time, but this Chinese invasion of NA servers is still very present), or play on EU servers or others with 200+ ping and be at a consistent disadvantage. The devs do not actually care for the player base, too, evidence is that they added in crates in the game-when promised they will not have them until after early access, they ran advertisements on Chinese clients on PUBG for a VPN service ([url=https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/73f5ph/china_advertisements_steam_reviews_bombed_is_this/]source[/url]), then Player unknown (AKA Brendan Greene) has the audicity to call his player base as 'xenophobics' for saying that Chinese players are causing a problem, which if you think playing in server where more than half the players have above 500 ping in a FPS game(along with statistics from their anti-cheat system saying majority of banned players are chinese-[url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/16/99-of-pubgs-banned-cheaters-are-from-china]source[/url]), then I'm not sure of what to tell you. I don't recommend this game until the devs get a sense on how to treat their consumers, obviously they do not care at all because, well, we're already giving them money so why should they? Unless their source of money starts to fade, they'll stay in this area of ""Who really cares about the consumers? They'll pay us for anything at this point, the idiots."" type of mindset. 

It hurts me to think that Player Unknown kind of sees us (Not definite, but deduction of given evidence) this way, but you can't hope for problems to be fixed if you don't attempt much. It's a fun game, I enjoy it. I don't recommend more people to get this game though, try the alternatives first and see if you like this style of a game, and maybe wait until the PUBG corp shows that they really do care for us.

PUBG feels like a student project that has continued to stumble through and gain momentum as there are no other challenges from a Battle Royale game in this style - Fortnite has stratospherically taken off, however the overall pacing, mechanics and visuals are vastly different to PUBG.

This game is run by the most incompetent developers. There are bugs and glitches here that have been present from the game's Early Access launch and I can only imagine this far in to the games lifecycle that they will never be fixed. Basic, fundamental concepts to PUBG are sometimes *literally* impossible to achieve in game; from being unable to revive team mates, vehicles flying 300ft in the air after driving over an empty field, items not spawning, healing items not activating, bullets travelling through players, grenades not going off, audio (most importantly, footsteps) not working at all and so much more. To me, it is genuinely astounding just how much PUBG Corp have managed to mess up this concept when the game took off like a rocket when it originally launched on Steam.

Bugs aside, if you have played an online multiplayer game in the past 10-15 years, I implore you to go nowhere near this sham. Did you ever play a online game on your Nintendo Wii? There is a 95% chance it will run better than this steaming heap of incompetence. Go on to Reddit, YouTube or Twitch and take a look at some PUBG clips surrounding desync - players are being shot around walls, buildings, rocks, trees, vehicles, etc.  The spectator/replay cam shows players firing 5-10ft behind someone else, with blood spouting out of thin air as if the devil himself is wearing Harry Potter's invisibility cloak and you are accidentally hitting him and not your intended target. 

Desync not bad enough? Let's talk about bullets. Where do they go? I fire bullets that are very, very clearly going through the skull of another player - do the bullets vanish?  Does the enemy consume them and regain health?  Are they bouncing my shots back at me? That's okay though, because when I go around the corner to reload I will die from behind the wall as the player shoots where I was standing 5 seconds prior.

Another issue is audio.  Audio was previously functioning and now it is not.  How you ask?  I have literally no idea. What I can tell you is that some players have zero footstep noise, they could be walking 10cm beside you and you will not hear them as they seemingly levitate above the ground.  Meanwhile, your own footsteps will be making the noise of 1,000 elephants trundling over a sea of vehicles. Gunfire will sound like it is beside you and could be half the map away.

You can become good at this game, but there is no point. Becoming good gives you an advantage but PUBG is so consistently against you from items not spawning, desync, players teleporting and audio issues that there are just so many RNG moments going against you, every single game and you will begin to notice it more and more.

Oh, you thought we were done?  Not yet! Why don't we talk about PURB Corp constantly adding and removing features, seemingly for no reason, despite the community begging for them? Before Sanhok was released, players were able to chose which map they wanted to play on - Erangel or Miramar, well, this has essentially been removed. They bundled Erangel and Miramar in to the ""Battle Royale"" playlist and Sanhok in the ""Mini Royale"" playlist, this has a massive negative impact on the game as players will instantly leave Erangel or Miramar games, depending on which map they want to play, lowering the player count for each map and upping queue times.

Microtransactions! Ah yes, the one thing PUBG Corp said they wouldn't do and have continued to pile on the lootboxes, limited time parachute skins, limited time gun skins and other such garbage instead of attempting to fix the utter mess of the game. When you play PUBG you will earn Battle Points, or BP.  BP is used to purchase in game crates... which are 99% of the time locked. To unlock the crate you must go and purchase a key, for that specific crate - this was something that never used to be in the game and more often than not crates used to be free to open.  As this essentially rules out a lot of the, very minimal, progression this game has - why do we still earn BP instead of just straight up purchasing crates or microtransactions? The Sanhok Event Pass was also released and was bugged to hell - some missions were unlocking without meeting the requirements, others were not unlocking despite actually doing the required tasks. The descriptions of each task were in complete broken English, which they have attempted to fix and still can't get right.  Think about that.  This developer can not create a coherent sentence/description for an event pass, that you need to pay real money for, so you have a very difficult time understanding what is actually being asked of you.

Your game will crash.  All the time.  Several times.  A day.

Do you want to use the replay system to see how that cheeky camper killed you when you were standing behind a 2 tonne metal container? TOUGH! As the game will just crash over and over and over again every time you attempt to use the replay feature.

PUBG is also plagued with hackers; some hackers will hit you with a frying pan from 1km away, others will aim at the floor with a pistol and shoot you from the opposite side of a mountain, where they can't see you.  Some players are invisible, others can fly, see every play on the map and others just might take zero damage. Does looting for 15-20 minutes and fending off enemy players, before being hit with a machete from 900m away sound fun to you?

Game optimization is, excuse the language, fucking shocking.  It has become worse.  This game, which let me remind you, ""fully released"" in December 2017 after a period in Early Access has worse performance now than it did several months ago. You can turn off the replay and death cam features, lower your settings and update your drivers - PUBG will drop to 10fps, 15fps or maybe, if you are lucky, 30fps.

PUBG and the developers are a sham, nothing gets fixed, nothing is ever commented on and the playerbase is looking for that next good Battle Royale game that is not Fortnite, and when it releases, because it will, the playerbase of this game will sink quicker than the Titanic. Don't let that distract you from the latest miniskirt you have a 0.003% chance of unlocking from this crate, if you buy a key!

Do yourself a favour and avoid this game at all costs and spend your money on literally anything else.  I was holding off on writing a review for this title as I had enjoyed my time with it for a while, often checking back in to see how it had improved and to my disbelief it is constantly getting worse, in every aspect. I can't recommend this to anyone.

EDIT: Literally one day after I posted this review a ""bug fix"" was released and actually broke the game more.  PUBG now has a bug where you can not use healing items; trying to use med kits, first aid, bandages, painkillers or energy drinks in your inventory or via your keybinds may not work.  In this case, you can not heal and you have just been PUBG'd once more.  Also, they just released a new lootcrate!  Mo' bugs, mo' crates, mo' problems.

im not going to bash the game it's a really good game, the game is good on all aspects except servers are some times really bad i experienced many glitches, full of hackers, but what turned me off this game or what i feel is worng is that the game is held by the worng people who could have made this game better or maybe they sould get a better anti-cheat, that's what happens when a company accidentally make a fun game, YES i got banned! for what? i dont know, people would accuse me of hacking when i was not. i did not get a change to play the new 1.0 update, because i got the ban 10 hours before the release, so this is an EARLY ACCESS REVIEW*
who knows maybe the next time you start the game you get banned.

The ban DID NOT effect my opinion about the game it just made me write this reivew.

I loved the game and it has brought my squad together, made new friends, learned new things during all the small talk moments we had while waiting for the zone to close in. 

HOWEVER, this game has had millions of issues since day 1. Now that they have made millions of dollars in money and cannot fix everything by now with 1-2 experienced professional coders. YET THEY KEEP ADDING MORE PAY-TO-UNLOCK CRATES ON A PAID GAME (Unlike TF2 and CSGO) 

Hit Registration issues, tick-rate issues, cars colliding with weird edges in the terrain, all completly terrible and still not fixed. Just recently my internet died mid-game and thankfully PUBG had the ""rejoin match"" feature right? WRONG, it gave me ""Connection Failure"" and I couldn't rejoin my game with a friend.

There have been moments where I was shot despite not being in the FOV of the killer. There have been moments where I also prefire a corner and see the impacts, but none of the shots register.

The gameplay is great and slow paced enough to be enjoyable unlike COD and its blazing-fast, nonsensical combat. That is the biggest plus I have got. But honestly, after 642.4 hours in this game and the non-functional rejoin match button, the final vertebra of the camel's back has been broken.

As the gaming industry progresses, we are introducted to a new type of genre; Battle Royale. PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a great example of a battle royale game you should avoid like the plague. Do not be decieved by the high twitch viewer count, or its immense popularity throughtout the internet. This game is not worth your time nor your money. 

To put it straight, this game doesn't deserve it's final release. The game is riddled with hackers and is low quality in terms of today's standard. Yes, the game has lovely looking graphics, but it's so poorly optimized to the point where the highest  end, top of the line PC's struggle with it. The amount of hackers in this game is absurd and Bluehole has done jack shit about it. There's not a single thing I can praise Bluehole for since they decided to ruin a perfectly fine game by not caring about it's major flaws. They were given a clear solution to hackers; region lock China, yet they didn't do it. ""Why ban an entire region of hackers from playing when we can spread them out"". 

Obivously, I'm hating on PUBG a little too much. The game itself if it were to be optimized would be a joyful experience that's thrilling and fun with friends. The problem is, there are much better alternatives to PUBG. Why spend $30USD when you can play an actual good battle royale such as Fortnite, where the company actually cares about the state of their game and is actually ""playable"".

PUBG well where should I start. The biggest title which has been added into the genre of Battle Royale games. If I had to say only one sentence about this game. It would be: It is broken !!! From my childhood I love the thoughts of any catastrophic scenario and how I can deal with survival. This game was a good opportunity to try survival of this type. I have to say that my own more expensive titles and I do not mind occasionally spending more money for the game. Interesting thing is there has never been an official discount on the game, and elsewhere it's about 5 € cheaper than on steam. We have solved this relatively expensive price. When you realize how the game became immediately popular and how many million copies were sold, then realize it is expensive and there are no discounts on it. You have to find out that the studio immediately earned a tremendous amount of money. And now we get to the point of the joke. The studio has earned so big amount of money and the game is literally broken. Bugs are absolutely everywhere. In such fundamental matters that you ask. The game is really so fucking broken? Optimization is really horrible and you can be cool that your PC is old and needed to improve but it is definitely not. There are many games that are far more sophisticated on the graphics and any other way. And they still work much better. Another thing is the servers. If I ever hated a game for the quality of servers such as ubisoft I take it back. Because PUBG did not win the prize for the best game in 2017, but the game with the worst servers in the world in 2017 (for me). Again we get to our point of joke. The studio owns a huge amount of money but is unable to buy and set up high-quality servers. Everybody knows what I'm talking about and in the game where time matters a delay of 3 seconds at each door or every lag that is caused by the server during the fight is really sad. But right now we'll stop and say the patches go quite often. But what is it for? Let's look at the official release of PUBG the biggest update to version 1.0. We got some FPS and a new map. But the update itself has brought extremely big number of new bugs. Another thing is cheaters. There is no point in disassembling them. They are simply an unacceptable number of them, and I do not see a solution on which bluehole studio works. This is probably everything I wanted to say, and until it's better, this review will not change. In short, it was not the greatest success in 2017 but the biggest failure and the easy way to make money.

Update for 13.01.2018
- game  crushing in important situations

Update for 03.02.2018
- in game is more and more cheaters

Update for 25.02.2018
- servers still down, cant connect 
- in some situations people dont have hitboxes 

Update for 22.06.2018
- battle pass is total copyright of fortnite 
- people without battle pass can not do even 1.lvl (or it takes 2000 hours)
- another forcing to buy broken stuff

Update for 01.07.2018
- unplayable thanks to cheaters and useless anticheat of Bluehole

Update for 22.12.2018
- total trash update
- on my build droped to unplayable 15-30fps gameplay, total lags and FPS drops
- servers still the same shit, people can kill you even when you behind the wall

PlayerUnknown needs to add more modes, and make the game not turn into another casechaos sh*tfest game, it was garbage in early stages but damn did it have a good start when it came to playerbase.... Lets make sure not to lose it? :s

But, behind my moaning, this game is good, and it is fun with mates at times, but over all, it's just another Battle Royale game, nothing special, not right now to say the least.

The zombie mode that was introduced was something new, and fun. But this badly needs more modes, Battle Royale gets old fast.

Not stopping anyone from getting it though, buy it and see for yourself whether you like it or not. But be warned, it's a battle royale with cases.

I remember the EA days when I saw real potential going forward for this game. Sure, it had terrible optimization, connectivity issues, bugs, and terrible driving mechanics among other things but all that could be fixed through the process of updating the game for full release. Instead, they rushed full release well before they should have, which brought more problems than before. Funny thing is, the game just continually gets worse somehow. Optimization is better but not at all great, servers can go down at random moments, cheaters have now plagued the game, driving and gunplay has gotten immensly worse with the invisible bumps and walls that will crash your car. Just to add to the problem, this event pass was released and it is just atrocious. Unrealistic goals, daily xp caps, small timeframe for the event, and the necessity to pay to upgrade the pass...I don't even have words. We can assume that they got this idea from Fortnite, but if they had the idea to make their own pass...why couldn't they also have the idea to model it more like Fortnite's which is better in every regard.

At this point, I can only assume that these developers are just shooting themselves in the foot or just plain don't care anymore. You can use the excuse that they weren't expecting such a huge player base for only so long before you have to start blaming them. Instead of fixing any of the issues that are running rampant in the game, we get more cosmetics that are locked behind a paywall (even when they insisted that they wouldn't become that kind of game). Hey look a new map...that brings more bugs and problems with it. I'm glad they sure know what we want, as more and more people jump ship to Fortnite or other games. It's kind of sad to watch something I had hoped to succeed get poorly run into the ground by a bunch of people that really want to just milk it for money. Quick full release for a cash grab, microtransactions all over the place, and the advertisements scattered throughout the game are just disgusting.

I picked up the game immediately when it got out of Early Access primarly because when I tried it before It got released , the optimisation was horrible. I was hesitant if I should pick it up but I did at last. But I was very suprised that when I started to play there was no lag. The game had been optimised and it looked even more beatufull than before.I was shocked. The devs actually did improve it a lot since Early Access. I started playing every day with my mates. We had soo much fun. Tho that wasn’t for long...
After a couple of uldates rolled by I started noticing huge lag spikes, FPS drops and what not. It wasn’t very playable. Then the problem with cheaters came by and other stuff. The devs kept promising that they will fix the issues with the next patch and so on and so on. But that fix never came. Instead what did they do? Add more paid crates,cosmetics,weapon skins and uselles shit. But why not? I mean I’m sure that this will fix the game. Then they started working on a new map...WHY???? Fix your fucking game guys. Oh let’s not forget to mention that while all of this is happening , they are working on a fucking Xbox 1 port of the game which is shittier than the Mobile port of the game. At this time I’m wondering what the fuck happened to Bluehole. I mean dude...the fucking mobile port is stable than the PC one...
And you might think that it can’t get worse. Well you are actually wrong. Currently Bluehole is suing Fortnite for copying PUBG !? What the actual fuck? Now this...this is what blew people
 away. By this logic , H1Z1 should sue PUBG for copying it. And why didn’t Bluehole sue Fortnite when it came out? Because they saw now that Fortnite is better and PUBG is falling behind.Or they just can’t handle the competition? Whatever the case is this is the most stupid thing they ‘ve done.

[i]About time I post a review on this game after spending a hundred hours on it and decided to completely drop it. While this game is the most hyped battle royale and the most played game on Steam itself sadly, it didn't reach my expectations. There are other similar games out there that are better overall with a more unique feel added to it.[/i]

[h1]==[ Pros ]==[/h1]

[b][+][/b] Arguable the most realistic battle royale out there. (bullet drop, physics, graphics, etc.) 
[b][+][/b] Regular patches. Devs are constantly bringing updates.
[b][+][/b] Packed with content. 2 maps (another 2 in the making), a lot of guns + mod variations, and cosmetics)

[h1]==[ Cons ]==[/h1]

[b][-][/b] Poorly optimized. The people who brags on how smooth it runs plays on a high-end PC but that doesn't change the fact that the poor optimization is present. It got better
[b][-][/b] Cheaters. It doesnt have it's own anti-cheat engine and it's not VAC supported.
[b][-][/b] Cash-grab and poor market economy. You'll get bombarded with the trash cosmetics (a lot of it) while the decent up to the good ones are worth from hundred to thousands of dollars because their loot drop rate is astronomically rare.
[b][-][/b] Bugs. Sometimes the mic stops working for no reason or you get unlimited loading screen. You'll have to restart the game a couple of times because of it.

[i]Have to thank all the players who buy insane amount of chest right there to test their luck. I was able to get back the money I spent on this by selling a lot of crates.[/i]

The idea behind the game is very good and addictive, so addictive in fact, that it took me less than a year to get to a thousand hours in-game. 

With that said, I wouldn't recommend the game, if you're looking for a ""fair fight"" or a game that is highly determined by players' skill. Skill of course helps, sure, but there is just SO much luck involved in winning early and late game fights. Early game is pretty much a coin flip. It often comes down to if you find a decent weapon quickly. Late game you need some luck with the zone, but good movement and smart decisions are a factor, too. 

In general, there is too much luck involved for this game to become an E-Sport in my opinion. Look, all the big popular E-Sports are solely skill-based and have little to no ""luck factor"".


Another hot topic for me is how the devs handle their game. The game STILL has countless bugs, crashes and glitches that hinder a nice experience. Some of them have been prevalent for more than half a year, but are still not fixed. But for the devs it seemed to be much more important to push the game out of early access and implement microtransactions rather than releasing a polished product. 

And why the heck is there no skill-based matchmaking? Matching bad playrers (K/D below 1) against aim-gods seems unneccessarily unfair. Some matchmaking based on the K/D or killrating would be very welcome. Maybe that way, cheaters would end up playing against cheaters, who knows...

By the way, regions should be locked completely. Not only China, but all of 'em. Every region gets to play on their respective servers without the option to choose other servers.

PUBG is just a cheap battle royale game with cheaters all around. And why cure the disease? Nah, we won`t do a thing - we`ll just ban a MILLION accounts so Chinese pro gamers with 47 chromosomes buy our game for the second, third or God knows, fourth time. 

They`re everywhere - on NA servs, on EU - everywhere but their own ASIAN SERVERS. 

Just create pure Chinese hell - [b]REGION LOCK[/b] China so a 100 cheaters play with each other. Now that`s gonna be a real f**king royal battle.",1520594192,1520594192,False,5,0,0.58668816089630127,1,True,False,False

I cannot recommend it, and the outlook that I will ever change my mind on this is bleak. Not due to stubbornness on my part, simply due to BlueHoles inability to fix the core problems of the game thus far. 

This is not a reflection of the Battle Royale genre, nor possible fatigue of those type of games within the industry, but of core problems with how this game runs. 
[List]
 [*] When it comes to FPS/TPS games it is the standard that when you shoot someone first(barring excessive ping differential, which also poses problems under this model) that you will kill them if you are aiming well. 
In PubG, due to position interpolation and clientside hit and kill detection, the game does not quite achieve that standard. It is not uncommon to get shot and hit up to 1-2 seconds after getting behind cover. This results in very frustrating deaths, it just feels like you're being blatantly lied to. 
It is the crux of online fps games to die or miss a kill when you played correctly and technically should be rewarded, but due to the way games/servers handle conflicting client reports, you are punished. This is a problem of varying degrees for every online multiplayer shooter, but for PubG it is [b]visibly[/b] exacerbated. This is my biggest problem with the game, as combat interactions typically take up only a slim portion of the game. It just makes it all the more annoying when you finally get a fight and it feels like you didn't get a fair chance(Not to mention RNG mechanics of the game) 


[*] General Responsiveness to input is poor. This includes item pick-up, movement, and environement interactions. For instance, the discrepancy between looting through tab-loot/drag-drop compared to press to pick up, clear delay when entering/exiting a vehicle, and of course jumping, vaulting, and general movement, [b]everything feels delayed and sluggish.[/b] Even under ideal conditions with low ping, good framerate, and small server load(30 remaining players) these issues will remain to a degree.
[/List]

Frame Timings, Game Tick Rate, and how they tie to server desync and instability have been problems since the game first became playable. Surprisingly, this is where BlueHole made clear and visible improvements, and when things worked they really seemed to be getting close to getting a handle on things. Lately however(specifically since Sanhok), the game has regressed in this regard, and even through the improvements, much of the [b]core issues[/b] still remained.

This has led me to believe it is no longer an optimization problem, but a [i]foundational problem[/i] with the way the game was designed and programmed. This is why I no longer believe the game will ever be fixed, and why I cannot recommend it to potential buyers. It is strange that they managed to blunder on so many important aspects, yet managed to have phenomenal ballistics and hitboxes. 

If the game didn't have these problems I would happily call it one of my favorite games. Even now, despite [i]all these problems[/i], [b]I am not saying you won't have fun on it.[/b] I will however say that the fun is few and far between all the nonsense and worthless rounds you have to deal with. So if you're like me and you love first person shooters(TPS as well, the issues remain regardless), then buy this game with significant caution. If you don't like FPS/TPS, or you just don't know, I would advise staying away.",1530921362,1530921909,False,5,0,0.586466193199157715,0,True,False,False

OR 
If I actually want to kill things and have fun, I land in a high loot zone. But then I have to contend with the TERRIBLE server lag. If I beat the server lag and the other players I have to contend with the boring ass mid game.

Speaking of lag, the network lag in the game progressively got worse and now is just terrible. Can't stand it.

You either have to be a 50-60 year old dad to enjoy this game since it's so slow.
You have to have the temper to contend with the early game server lag.
You have to be a top streamer to enjoy a fast paced game, like every top stream I watch like Shroud, etc they're being streamsniped and it's so fun for them and to watch because they're just destroying all the streamsnipers around them. 

Me..? I see no one lol.

This genre is really just starting out they may be plenty choice soon so don't bank on PUBG yet. Fortnite is a good one to try for now if you like a faster game, it's also free. H1Z1 dropped the ball don't bother.
Pubg is a good game, but it's just inherantly slow and it's getting worse in terms of lag so I can't recommend it at this time. I had a blast last year though!",1516815121,1516833721,False,6,0,0.586088955402374268,1,True,False,False

The vision was great - I will tolerate the bugs for now, developers will eventually fix them and I will be able to enjoy game built on top of an excellent idea with my friends. 
Sadly, none of that is going to happen. Blue hole studio pushes hard for draining player's money in any way possible while totally ignoring that their game is broken and full of bugs. It feels like they just decided that on top of 30€ game, they will implement every possible microtransaction you can think of. That sort of behavior would be understandable for free to play game developers, not when we are talking about the studio developing a game you buy for 30€ which is utterly broken and literally everyone is waiting for fixes.

To add insult to the injury Bluehole decided that they should sue Fortnite for ripping off their idea. I have never played it, but seriously guys? Battle Royale is not even the concept you invented. And from the videos it looks like the game is very different. If this is one more of your attemps to get money out of people, well, well done then.

They took in about 750 million dollars from the game alone... not including their piece of the market transactions and they can't get a decent Dev team to clean up the game and make it functional? Give me a break! All their decisions for this game are with pure greed in mind and not the playing community...

Don't bother and spend your money on other BR style games. None of which seem to suffer from the same garbage that this game has dealt with since beta.

So I got a love/hate relationship at this game cause it's so much fun with friends and it gives adrenaline rush when you enter gun fight over a chicken dinner. But at the same time... you usually die without a gun or get shot in the back while you have the best gear possible. But that is not the reason why I HATE the game. The reason why i hate the game is that over 20% of the time I get killed is by hackers. I know I know... "" It's not my fault the enemy had cheats!!!"" like every gamer has always said at one point of their gaming time but I SERIOUSLY mean it. Ever since they made the death cam a thing, I've seen a lot of people killing me either by instantly flicking from one persons head to another persons head or by shooting me through walls and even hills. 

I just came from game where i got hit ALL the time from ""weird"" angles. This guy didn't try to kill me, he was harassing me by shooting me once or twice and then letting me heal up. I wasn't the only one he was doing this. I was in top4 with me, the hacker and 1 duo alive. He was switching shots between us always hitting us even though they and me were hiding behind buildings and hills. The Duo died and it was just me and him. I saw him run behind a building and still I was getting shot. My friend who was dead said that this guy is yelling at me ingame so I turned it on and noticed it was chinese what this guy was yelling. Then he started taunting me with broken english while shooting me to keep me low hp. When he noticed that I'm not healing anymore then he stopped and kept taunting me. Well of course this story doesn't have a happy ending and i died to a circle cause I didn't want him to get the satisfaction of ending me. Appaerantly it was mortar hack that killed me.

I have nothing against chinese players who want to play on EU or NA but people will continue insisting on region locking because of the amount of hackers that are coming from China. As long as the hacker problem exist the players that want region lock will continue to have a more legitimate ground to stand on and the game will lose it's playability. Fix the hacker problem and people will enjoy the game and want to come back to the game. Then there won't be so big of a leg to stand on for the region lock.

I hope this won't be a case of ""We dont want to fix it cause it'll give us money, 1 ban=1 bought copy hehexD.""

I have an abusive relationship with this game. It beats me unfairly many times to my knees and yet I come back to get that abuse. But no more. I am giving up. I am waiting for you to do something against the cheats. As long as the problem is this HUGE, it'll be negative review in my books. I'm spent for writing this review. I'm done with the abuse.

Optimization is still bad and.. oh man. So you save up your in-game currrency, then after you had enough currency, you can buy crate(s).

You bought it with the in-game currency and the thing needs to be opened with REAL money, i was thinking.. ""Damn, they already made a lot of money and they tried to make EVEN MORE money?!"" 

The video trailer of the game said ""OVER 20 MILLION DOWNLOAD"" game's price is $35, now FUCKING think about it, 

35 x 20.000.000 = $700.000.000

Now they actually make more than that, because? KEYS TO UNLOCK CRATES, and MORE THAN 20 MILLION PLAYERS.

and guess what? They decided to ""Oh, let's make EVEN MORE money by adding weapon skins! this game is already perfect and we don't need to add anymore optimization and bug fixes!""(no, they didn't say that, but still)

I finally did it, I uninstalled this piece of shit laggy, desync, hacker infested money making crap!!!! I have not felt better!!! I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH DONT BUY IT< DONT TRY IT !!!!!

Got over 1000 hours played now. 
All i can say is DONT BUY THE GAME ! 
Its a great game, but it is over run with hackers, to the point that is really unplayable.  
9/10 Games i get speed hacked and aimboted. 
9/10 duos i get matched with a Chinese that does not speak the language. ( I am NA)
I see the same hackers 1-2 weeks later. 
Until Bluehole gets a handle on the hacks dont buy it!!!!!
 Do your self a favor. 
I will keep this review updated if they ever get a handle on the hackers.

Once AGAIN DONT BUY IT, U will get hacked ALOT and this game that is suppose to bring u joy will make u feel helpless and like shit!

I have tried playing all day today and no matter what server i go, what team i join (Solo Duo or team i got hacked 100% of my matches ! AGAIN DONT BUY THIS GAME IT IS UNPLAYABLE! 
The devs are not doing shit. If i could stil lget my money back i would!

Tried playing FPP for the last 2 days and the hacking is alot less its not 10/10 its about every 5/10 matches. Still unplayable if u ask me. 
Hackers are getting smarter too, they now down u but dont finish u, so that the next legit group u run into you have no helm and no vest. 
Or the newest one i have seen alot is the hacker will get u down to a sliver of health the the partner or the rest of the team will kill u. This way u dont even have a option to report the hacker. 
AGAIN DONT BUY IT!!! Please SAVE yourself the frustration and the felling of being completly helpless. I dont care how many they are banning, or how many they say they are IT IS NOT ENOUGH NO WHERE CLOSE ! 

If i could give it multiple tumbs down i would!

After full release the game was great to play again, did not encounter any hackers. 7 days into the full release i get hacked 9/10 games again. 
Once again dont buy it
2 WEEKS INTO THE 1.0 full release:
Rubberbanding hard after dropping into a high player area
LAG so incredible at the beginning u cant tell if they hacking or its lag. 
Fences still stop bullets but most of the time only from one side. 
Get the perfect ladning and still take a lil damage.
Desync of bullets in FPP is out of control. Specially on shotguns. 
Shoting at players on the horizon i see my bullets hit a invisible wall! (Like the bullets is hitting dirt instead of the player. 

Took a 1 hour break came back and got hacked 3/3 games. 
There is no doubt in my mind any more having the death cam. 
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE and Bluehole is doing nothing there is more hackers then non hackers in this game !

1.0 release couple weeks in ""SERVERS ARE TO BUSY PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER""
50% of the time when i log on i get this message. I can sit in on my main screen for 30 minutes and nothing happens. Never went past that time i dont have the patience.
UNPLAYABLE....litarally!!!

So new map new patch!!! Still complete crap! Dont buy it! dont get sucked into this desync hacker fest ...Just dont do it. This game will never be hack free.
oHHH ALMOST FORGOT ....10/10 GAMES I GET FUCKING 3 ASIAN NO ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLE ON NA OR EU!!!!
Ping Lock for all them china hacker .....NOT WORKING every match i got into 80% chineese 9 out of 10 games i am matched with 3 other chineese. GAME BROKEN

[*]People might argue that if you cant kill them maybe you should just hide and camp. But imagine you doing nothing but sitting in a cornor until the blue circle of death comes near to you. 
[*]The real pain is that this game has no tutorials or training mode at all, you need to figure it our on your own in real game, where people in game are equipped with tons of expensive gaming kits.
[*]Maybe learning in game can be a good experience for a few, but if you have little or no idea about this game you are gonna suck, Youtube/Twitch may seem right choice for learning, but if it is the case it means that you are learning while watching not trying it yourself, which again contradicts play and learn concept.
[*]The gaming is made as complicated as possible. If you need to play this game you even need to communicate, because there almost no assist at all. 
[*]This game even lacks language preferences, suppose you think of playing [i]Squad[/i] with random teammates, you will often get people speaking language you probably dont understand. This is more common in Asia server.
[*]Even the matchmaking is not like that you will get player of your level. It feels like it just matches you with 100 random online players. Overall its very hard for beginner to play this game. I would love being refunded for this game.

First of all, I'd like to point out that this game CAN be quite fun, but it is far from being finished.

Controls and Fluency:

If you have played a well-made, responsive game before, you'll notice how this game is neither.
You'll often notice some kind of 'drag' when moving the camera. 
The controls are really not responsive at all by standards of modern games. If you want to use your scope/zoom in, it will take the game way too long, which is quite inconvenient since you die very quickly. I'm quite sure this has nothing to do with ""realism"", it's just bad programming.

Gameplay:

The gameplay can be quite thrilling. Really gets ruined by the unpolished engine, though.
Although VERY boring when not playing with friends.

Price and Microtransactions:

As far as the money's concerned, this game just shits into its customer's face. 
The game is a LOT less polished than other multiplayer games like CS:GO/Overwatch and seriously lacks quality.
I'd say it's a really fancy mod, but certainly nothing more than that. Henceforth, 30 Euros is WAY too much for this game and I really advise you not to buy this game at full price, but rather wait for a sale. Not because the game isn't fun, but because you shouldn't support greedy developers.
Now guess what? THERE ARE MICROTRANSACTIONS! As if paying 30 Euros for an unfinished game wasn't enough!

As you might be able to tell, the developers aren't exactly trying to hide the fact that they are trying to milk your wallet.

All in all, if you really want this game, get it. I know many people who actually enjoy this. If you just want to play Battle Royale, play Fortnite (it's free). If you are into really polished shooting games that are actually rewarding and fun to play, try CS:GO (10€ on sale) or Overwatch (20€ on sale).",1518889875,1518898436,False,5,0,0.583333313465118408,0,True,False,False

But, it still is a mess and even more a farce that they now say: ""Hey, we released a second map now, let's call us the game finished and stable"" Wich in fact is a lie! 
The game is far from finished. De-synchs all the way, not recognized bullet impacts, glitches all over, false bans for no reason because ""hey, look, we ban thousands of people every day, we care"" but only to make half of them to buy a new copy because it wasn't their fault and so on
The game concept is as old as gaming (not only computer) and thats all.
I stopped playing it because of the said reasons. Had a few really good moments but with all those ""mouse driver user"" out there, it's not fun anymore. And by saying ""Mouse driver user"" be aware that there are a lot of pages selling scripts for the mouse drivers to eleminate the weapons recoil completely and it's not even detected because it's a fucking regular mouse driver program ... Most of the banned people got caught on video (a lot of well known youtuber aswell) by seeing them shooting hundreds of meters w/o any recoil.

There's something about it that makes it enjoyable (mechanics, gameplay, etc.), but at the same time the game has a lot of issues especially on the technical side, and that makes it FRUSTRATING as hell.

Admittedly, this game is fun across all modes, solo or with friends. The aspect of parachuting to random places (whether you want to go to remote or high-risk areas) and get started with looting, then looking for your targets and trying to eliminate them is what draws me, and most probably others, to this game. There's nothing more satisfying than being able to kill someone with a Karabiner 98k over long distances, a Micro UZI in CQB, or just punching someone to death early on. There's a lot of ways to eliminate your targets and that is also the fun part of it.

The game's challenge is also what I admire, there's definitely a steep learning curve despite being easy to pick up. Things such as bullet drop, the proper use of weapon attachments, leaning, etc. You can lose to gunfights a lot more than you'd expect but it serves as a learning experience to improve next time.

I could go on and on about this game's positives, but to me, the negatives far outweigh it which makes the game really hard to enjoy sometimes, and increasingly moreso every patch.

Here's a few things (bugs, inconsitencies, etc.) that really frutrates the hell out of me:

- Trying to pass between a broken wall, or between any other objects for that matter, but you won't be able to unless you jump off a bit (Yes, this costed me a Chicken Dinner, but whatever).
- There's a church in the Graveyard area in Miramar that won't allow you to climb up a staircase near the entrance to the bell tower normally. You'd have TO JUMP/VAULT OVER THAT PARTICULAR STAIRCASE.
- If you try to shoot someone in far away distances, it doesn't end up hitting them because apparently, THERE'S AN OBJECT (ROCKS, ETC.) THAT DIDN'T PROPERLY RENDER IN FRONT OF THAT TARGET, HE WAS ACTUALLY HIDING BEHIND IT. You only find out about it if you die to that target and watch the Death Cam/Replays to find out what's happening.
- There's some serious desync issue going on, especially when you get in a gunfight, and you're supposed to have landed all the shots, but you die first. Viewing the Death Cam shows that NONE OF THOSE SHOTS REGISTERED AT ALL.
- Some places (most notably ridges) will get you stuck even if they don't look like you could get stuck in them. There's no way out of it and the best you can do is to quit the match.
- When it comes to looting and switching/attaching weapon attachments, sometimes it feels like it takes forever to do so. I use item-dragging a lot as it feels the fastest for me compared to right-clicking or *shudders* pressing F. Though this doesn't help with the delayed response. I can't tell if it's a server or client-side thing, but this definitely needs to be looked at.
- It doesn't matter how good your PC specifications or internet speed is. The game's optimization is pretty far from decent, and their servers have plenty of problems (server errors, downtimes, network lag, etc.) that seems to get progressively worse every patch.
- Their ""fixes"" don't really fix anything, they don't even bother to face and address the problems the game has, instead they use workarounds as a temporary solution and then just stay with it, possibly never bothering to touch it again (An example would be fixing the lag in starting lobbies, they had to spread out player spawns across the map as a ""fix"").
- The way their updating system works is terrible. Most of the time you download a huge chunk of files (they can reach up to 8+ GB) for no good reason. They are mostly files that are just being redownloaded needlessly. This is not normal, as some of their updates don't even have that much content, and this goes way back during Early Access. Normally, game updates have around few hundreds of MB up to ~2 GB, depending on the size of the content.
- Speaking of updates, every patch day there's something in the game that always breaks. It usually ends up in a huge pile of mess, a few of them: not being able to see player names properly (#unknown, anyone?), crashes in the middle of the game (bad module, etc.), and some more.
- They are starting to focus too much on clothing (and recently weapon) skins, and even going so far as to add emotes. It's not that huge of a deal for me, but it makes me question their priorities. For a game that has become this huge, but still lacking a lot of things and needs a lot of fixing, shouldn't they be focusing on more important things?
- You will encounter cheaters everywhere. It does not matter which team mode (Solo, Duo, 3-man Squad, and Squad) and perspective mode (FPP and TPP) you play. Although for some reason there's definitely a lot more of them in TPP mode.
- Balance. What are they thinking? Weapon too OP in long range? Let's make it so that an 8x Scope can't be attached to it, brilliant! There's a lot more stupid balancing decisions, but I'm not going to bother listing them all.
- If you're looking to play with duos and squads, do not bother with Matchmaking. It's so bad it basically just puts you in with random players with no regard for matchmaking algorithms. The worst part is you'll probably encounter people who refuse to communicate properly and/or disregard teamwork. The best you can do is to join LFG groups (such as PUBG Discord), or just play with friends.

I'm sure there's a lot more I encountered, but as of now these are what I can think of.

Despite the fun I had especially with friends, I must say that I can't really recommend buying this game, not even on sale, considering the state the game is in right now. It may be out of ""Early Access"" back then, but to be honest, the game still doesn't feel like it's ready for a full release.

When this game was first offered in pre-release, the developers made several promises to supporters. Many of these were to prevent PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds from turning into Day-Z, where premium crates could be sold on Steam, allowing cheaters to cash in. Well, it didn't take long for PUBG to follow suit, and hackers continue to plague this game. Cheaters ruin the fun for somebody who fought their way to the final showdown, only to be instantly killed by somebody from China using an aimbot. There is not region, network, or ping locking, so somebody with a 1000+ ms ping can jump into a server where most people have sub-100 ms pings, and ruin the synchronization for everybody playing.

So far it sounds like this should be a 5 star review right?

Welllll. Theres an issue, this issue happens to come from a communist country on the other side of the world, and its absolutely destroying the games playability. That issue is, Chinese hackers.

Now, i had heard people complaining and never cared much, then the deathcam system came out and i realized just how huge of a problem it is. More than half the time my deaths where a result of people locking on to me through walls, buildings, entire complexes. then lazerbeaming me from a mile away.

You see, apperently in china the game costs substancially less, so to them they have no problem sitting in there internet cafe, hacking away, then buying a new account when they get caught. Add this with the huge lag issues resulting from people connecting from the other side of the world and you will find that a majority of mid game deaths, are due to BS with china.

Now the obvious solution is to reigon lock servers, makes sence right? other games do it, or even have the option to play on reigon locked servers. Well thats not going to happen, because according to the games creator, wanting to play on reigon locked servers makes you a racist. im not jokeing, these are his words, not mine.

Now, this also brings to attention that allowing the chinese problem to continue provides him significant financial gain, because like i said, these people are buying new accounts regularly. This allows the creatior to get dozens of sales off a single user, so it comes to question if the creator Brandon greene actually belives it to be racist, or if he is useing it as a easy ""Current Year"" pass off to what is largely a cash grab scheme.

So would i recomend the game? in an instant if it had reigon locked servers, but it does not. Make no mistakes the game is broken, the solution is simple, but the developer will not fix it because it makes him money.

I think the only thing we can hope for is that once the modding community kicks in reigon exclusive games can be formed, or servers that have ping limits. this might allow for the comminity to save the gameplay, but im not shure i would recommend buying it even if that occored simply due to the ethical bankrupsy of the devs.

I don't see how anyone can recommend this game to their friends, it's not great, the face of the game is a loon, they have pointless lawsuits trying to sue other Battle Royales for ""stealing"" frying pan assets from their game, they're starting the whole BATTLE PASS motif when it's pretty obvious this game has made a killing on Steam, I don't think I've seen it off the Global Top Seller since it got taken over by Twitch streamers, so what's the point? Sick new missions and renting cosmetic items that my favorite streamer owns 1000 of because he's a popular streamer? Oh and at the end of the Battle Pass, all your ""timed"" cosmetic items disappear. Nothing about this sounds pleasant. The only pass I'm getting is a HARD PASS on this one.

Finally, Battle Royale games don't need to be the new wave, we can be better as a society.",1529524062,1529524394,False,4,0,0.581749081611633301,0,True,False,False

After playing a decent amount of games, gaining a lot of experience and surely being in a lot of 'fair' situations, I'm finally able to say that this game, is as based on luck as a game of dice. Not only do you have to be extremely fortunate to find a 'reasonably good' weapon, you also have to be lucky enough the game actually allows you to pick up the weapon in the first case which it hardly ever succeeds at. Along with this problem most people can relate to, PUBG has a lot of these 'enjoyable bugs'. 

Imagine, 2 players with the same experience and gear are engaged in close quarter combat, who do you expect to win? The one with the PC and hardware advantage? No, you sir, you are wrong, for PUBG rewards the players playing with lagg by granting them the ability to shoot through walls and teleport around the map like a 12 year old with a delorean.
I am absolutely sure everyone can relate to this problem, not only is this incredibly annoying, it also makes players stop playing the game or install cheats instead.

The cure to these 'cheaters' (which are most defenitely present in 50% of the games) the game should be running fine, so the players who are clearly better than others are rewarded and stopped from downloading cheat clients.

After almost 2 years of terrible performance, the developers are still failing on giving the community the game they so desire. A game with solid ping, fps, graphics, models and servers. I am quite sure that the developers can do more than they're doing as of this moment, which is after all, not enough. I would recommend to ensure a good stable performance in game before adding other microtransacting accessories.


And therefore I do not recommend this game.

These hackers also know where everyone is on the map at anytime, have aimbot on with a 100% hit rate, and can see loot through walls. All in all, a really tough situation to combat for the regular non-professional player.

It gets even worse when you're in the final circles. A good 50% - 60% of players then are most likely hackers. Which means, little chance for you to have a fair fight.

That sounds right as a summary for this ********** they call a game.
Well it took me 400 hours to realize what a shitstain i play. 300 of those hours are just pure and utter crap, 100 hours are enjoyable. Not because of the game, but because you are fooling around with your friends ingame.

It crashes and freezes, EVERY SINGLE GODDAMN ROUND 1 out of 4 players in a squad got either a loading screen freeze, or a crash during the round.
Stutters during explosions have been introduced during one of the latest patches. Then your screen only freezes for 5 seconds, but you can continue to play. Hoooorayyyy for their testing team.

Cheaters are just in every 5-10th round. Still sucks when you loot 10 minutes, kill 4 people during the next 15 minutes, getting to the circle ... aaand be killed by a stupid chinese ******* cheater. Hey another half an hour down the drain.

Lags. EVERYWHERE. With a 250/25Mbit cable connection? Are you fucking kidding me?
Why do people shoot me, when i'm already behind the corner for half a second?
Why do their deathcams show, that they didn't even target me and are trailing by 3 meters?
Why do i fire a shot, hit the target (aka BLOODCLOUD appearing around the enemy), get shot by their double-shotgun - and in their deathcam i can see they DID NOT RECEIVE ANY DAMAGE?

I mean, I love the idea of the game, the fact its trying to be on the realistic side of things and the fact its a game you can actually work together with friends is a massive plus in my view. 

But, and this is the more important thing, it runs like crap (even on a 6 core with a 1070 gtx) and the devs are either incompetent or just plain greedy. 

With the amount of money they have made and the time they have had they could of had a team of (actually talanted) programmers completly re-write the game from the ground up whilst we made do with the original un-polished game.

Instead they fail to make it better (aguably worse usually) and they seem to think somthing like jumping a fence is a 6 month buildup ticker tape parade event. News flash devs, every other game has this sort of thing from day one because its almost as basic as running.

Granted, it may have been a small team to start, but this long in with that much money its just ridiculous that its still where it is today. This is a prime example of a good idea that regardless of how much is made the people involved arnt smart/motivated enough to pull it off. Unless they intended on making loads doing next to nothing right, in which case they smashed it. 

Its not only the devs to blame though, if half the people on here stopped buying the cr@99y cloths and skins they wouldnt spend all their time creating more of the cr@p but thats the way it is these days.

I've come to dislike the game, and I would not recommend it in it's current state.
I'm going to explain my dislikes about the game in a couple different subjects.

Bugs: I really enjoyed PUBG in Early Access and didn't mind the bugs and bad performance that came with it because it was in Early Access. I could accept it and enjoy the game for what it is. But as it's come to about four months after it's 1.0 Release, and the game still freezes occasionally near the start of the game and lags even with most all of the settings on low. This can kill you and it has killed me numerous times trying to get a gun and fight in hot-drop locations. This is not the only bug that I've encountered, as there are a couple more I can name, with more that I couldn't possibly name in this review otherwise the entire thing would be in this bugs section. There was a bug on the stairs in the Miramar map where you could vault through the wall and kill players from said wall. This wasn't patched for at least a week or two, and was abused like hell. I and many other players also get frequent game crashes from ""bad_module_info"", and while I've heard this is an issue with a Windows 10 update, this is the only game I experience it on, and Bluehole never decided to care or even try to fix this bug. TL;DR The game is still buggy even after 1.0 release, and the Devs would rather rake in that sweet, sweet dough with Weapon Skins than fix these bugs, and improve the performance of the game. It still runs awful even after everything. (If you want an idea of my computer specs: I run R6: Siege on Ultra settings at 60 FPS.)

Guns and Gunfights: I'm honestly not even sure where to begin with this. The gunplay is nice, the recoil on the guns feels good, and the designs and which weapons they decide to implement. They used to add guns pretty frequently and did so around the time they were in early access, but that has slowed down and they rarely add guns to the game anymore. I believe it's been around 3 months (when this review is posted) that they still have not added a new gun, which leads to a bit of a bore when it comes to weapon choices. This game has it's fair share of hit registration issues and it's a bit difficult to learn how bullet drop works on some of the 4x scopes since they've changed them in recent updates. It takes practice, I understand, but I've been at the game for 100+ hours since they've changed them and I still can't figure them out.
Now, for this next subject, I wasn't really sure where to place this but I suppose it'll do well in the guns and gunfights section. [b] Loot distribution: [/b] It's completely random, which I hate. It's a very strong word, but it repels me from dropping to hot-drop locations like; School, Prison, etc. I cannot explain to you how many times I've gone through whole buildings and never found a single weapon, while the guy in the house next to me finds an assault rifle and kills me right out the gate. Or if we're in the same building and it's a large building with a lot of rooms. I will go through 2-4 rooms and either find nothing, or a pistol in which my opponent finds a shotgun, or a rifle and proceeds to kill me because he either has the full advantage since I have no weapon, or has a very high advantage because he has a much more high powered weapon. Now I understand fully that this is a battle royale game, but that title doesn't give it the right to straight up [b] not give me a chance to fight back within the first few seconds of the game. [/b] It's unappealing, and generally makes you frustrated and angry when you get screwed by RNG multiple times over. I will also say that you could drop in the middle of nowhere since you have bad RNG, but this gets extremely boring and is also not a good way to learn the game in the first place.

Now that I've finished talkings about the guns and loot distribution, I want to go into the maps:
I want to start with Erangel, since this is the original map on PUBG. Now, I will say this. The map is far from perfect. But it's well designed enough that everyone is content with the map and the way it works. Cities and forests which allow you to traverse from and to each other pretty well, even with some mountains and hills in the mix. It's all around a very well designed map, though it has it's flaws. It's very well loved and it deserves the love it gets, because no matter how many times you play it, it's always fresh with the scenery and the enviroments you fight in. The buildings in the map are simple and well laid out, like I said the loot distribution is a bit wonky but they're still nice to fight in and are pretty easy to learn where the loot usually spawns.
Now, I will move on to the sandy deserts of Miramar. I absolutely, with all my heart, hate this map. I do not like how much a height advantage can screw you over on this map. It's hard to traverse, and the circle closing in with hills all around you usually makes you a perfect target ripe for the picking. The terrain is hot buns, while most vehicles cannot go too fast on it without flipping, and while trying to find cover in defilades could be a nice change of pace, there are too many hills and the gunfights in these hills are just not pleasureable in the least. The buildings are too big and have too much going on in them. They feel sloppy and the loot is too spread out in this buildings, and will make you spend a lot of your time just trying to find a decent helmet, or attatchments. Erangel does better with more simple buildings that are not dull, and are fun to fight in. Games also last a lot longer on Miramar, simply because of how big the landmass is. This can lead to frustration if you lose in the top 10~ because it takes you so goddamn long just to get there in the first place. One thing that lead me down the path to hating Miramar is.. it seems that you find yourself on the map more than you find yourself on the original, Erangel. I consistently find 3-4 games in a row on Miramar, and have even found around [b] 7 [/b] games in a row on Miramar. I am not exaggerating when I say 7, that is a real number and it is part of why I deeply hate this map. Movement is clunky, gunfights are not fun, buildings are too complex and take too long to loot, and the sun glaring in your eyes always makes targets hard to see. It's a huge mess of a map, and I hope they remake it one day.
Now, I cannot say much about the new map 'Savage' coming out soon, however it looks very well laid out with the buildings having a simple design on Erangel. Even though I have lost much interest in this game, I will definitely come back to try out the new map, as it's small scale brings more action and might just breathe new life into the game.

Events: Bluehole have decided to implement events around a month~ ago (when this review is posted), and all around I think it's a good idea. However, their ideas for event gamemodes have been lack-luster, and they don't stick around too long, which is also another let down in of itself. They could really make the game more interesting with these events, but they need to be longer and they need to come up with more fresh, interesting ideas. 
All in all, the idea is good, the execution is lacking.

I would wait to see if Bluehole decides they care about the game enough to see more bug fixes and performance issues lifted. 
[b] My overall experience with the game goes as follows: [/b] I loved the game when I bought it in early access, and I loved it up to the release, and about two months after that release. Then the game became tedious and boring for multiple reasons, one of which being the new map. I would be willing to play the game more if they breathed new life into the game with some new content, but for right now I can't bring myself to play it because of the preformance issues I suffer, to pair with the gameplay that is slowly becoming boring and stale.",1523099641,1523099761,False,14,0,0.577643990516662598,16,True,False,False

-Desync is still an issue
-It's impossible to track players while you're indoors as  the slightest obstacle will cause your character to flip their weapon up obscuring you view
-For a game that prides itself in gun fights, I've never experienced a clunkier game. Even non-AAA game companies can get smooth gun play right like TripWire in the RO2 and RS2 series
-Many of the maps such as Vikendi are still unoptimized and if you are in a car you run the risk of your game crashing
-Speaking of unoptimization, If you land with a lot of other people you may skip over weapons as they don't spawn yet and you will be killed
-Stun grenades can go off in the floor below you and you will somehow be blinded this I know from personal experience
-Cars in the game handle like rickety boats, the slightest divot in the road will give you the real risk of flipping the car. 
-Hacking is still prevalent in game

The cheating is that bad in this game. 

You will likely be able to enjoy the game, free of cheaters if you are either first starting out or after the usual stat wipes that occur each month I think it is. This was the case for me and my friends that usually squad up. We would win ""chicken dinners"" left and right. I think our record was like six games in a row, we placed first in a single night. However, because there is a very basic elo system in place, inevitably you will start to run into higher skilled players. This is normally a good thing though, you won't improve if you don't get challenged right? The problem is, at higher elos, is where all the cheaters are sitting as well. Your chances of running into cheaters become absurdly high very quick if you are even [u] remotely skilled[/u] at shooters.

The worst part is, the developer doesn't seem to even care in the slightest. Why do I assume this? They just keep adding new content without any update to the cheating problems. I'm all for new content, but you need to fix what you have first and they don't seem to understand that simple concept.

The cheating aside, they still have server problems also. Mainly de-sync issues. Have you ever played a shooter where you took aim with a [u]sniper rifle[/u] at someone that [b]isn't moving[/b] that also wasn't even [b]50 meters[/b] out, and STILL MISSED YOUR SHOT? Well if you haven't before, you will in this game. There is no excuse for this as the developers have certainly made enough money to get better servers or hire more staff to handle this type of stupidity. However, it still happens. ALOT.

Sorry PUBG Corp. but you guys suck at anti-cheat. I have never played an online game where the cheating is stupidly unchecked.

I miss the times when great games used to fight for Goty.The Last of Us vs GTA V(2013),Dragon Age vs Shadow of Mordor(2014),Fallout 4 vs Witcher 3(2015) are all good examples till Overwatch fu*ked up the gaming franchise in 2016.(We've still seen competition between Legend of Zelda and Horizon Zero Dawn but it didn't mean anything to the PC gamers.)These days just get a good enough server,pay enough critics,youtubers,streamers to play your game and you've received the GOTY award.Because these days,quality doesn't mean a fu*k to anyone.

The idea of battle royale wasn't bad,but PUBG is straight forward boring.The match time and the map are unnecessarily huge and there's nothing else to do other than looting sh*ts and camping.The gameplay feels completey reta*ted.You cannot take cover behind objects or dodge bullets and gunplay is unsatisfying.Some blind people will say that the graphics are good simply because it's bright and somewhat colorful.If u look closely you will notice anti-aliasing,texture quality,reflections completely sucks which makes the game look worse than PS3/X360 games.So much for improving the game after 1.0 launch,they completey removed weather variety from the game because they couldn't stabilize performance on variable weathers.

Why is it still the most played game?Simply because of the damn loot crates which u can sell or test your luck by gambling.However some very less number of people find the game truly addictive or will say it's a good game becuz they never played a game which was actually good and not overrated af.

Welcome to Pubg! 

After well over 200 hours into this game, I sadly recommend that you not purchase this product. The core reason being the overwhelming number of cheaters that plague the community. There are also be some bugs and glitches such as car physics going wonky at times and taking damage while climbing walls. While the bugs may be annoying at times, they rarely have a huge impact on gameplay. But dying to cheaters every other game completely kills the fun over time.

If you buy the game anyway I'm sure you'll have fun for a little while. Jumping into a town with +20 other people, you probably won't notice the cheaters much amongst all the chaos. And since you've only invested a couple minutes at most into that round it doesn't feel that bad when you die. But when you start getting to top 20, top 10, or even top 5 it hurts a whole lot more.

I was able to look past the problem for a while but after so many near victories were stolen from me/and my team I've lost interest in taking the game seriously.

It doesn't help that Blue Hole's method of dealing with cheaters is the same as what MMOs do with botters.  Wait on banning their accounts long enough so that the cheaters will go buy new accounts. I'm sure this strategy makes Blue Hole a nice chunk of change but I think it will ultimately drive the legitimate players away.",1520712326,1521777557,False,4,0,0.576271176338195801,0,True,False,False

Let's put this in the simplest way I possibly can.

The game is okay. It's fun only when playing with at least 1 other person. It runs well enough, looks acceptable (better than garry's mod), and the gunplay is way better than other similar games *COUGH* day z *COUGH COUGH*

A large negative for this game is that the servers (North America at least) are filled to the brim with people who can only speak Chinese. The Asian servers are full and the devs refuse to expand to accomodate them. As a result they spill into the NA Servers and lag everything out and shout nothing but insults and tote their toxic nationalism. This also creates an insurmountable language barriers that makes cooperation, coordination, and play with them impossible. To make matters worse over half of them cheat and the devs have even admitted this much. 

However despite knowing all of this the devs refuse to take any small amount of action about these issues. They use a 20 year old Anti-Cheat that might as well be the Pilsbury Dough Boy watching for cheaters. When the unignorable issue of chinese hackers is brought to the Dev's they only respond with a half baked ""Holier Than Thou"" response that was basically them calling us all horrible people for telling them they need to be kept on servers where their ping doesn't degrade play, their language doesn't cause cooperation issues, and their rampant and blatant cheating doesn't make the game worthless to the hundreds of thousands of others who aren't from there. It's not us being xenophobic. It's not us being racist. it's a simple fact, but the devs are drowing in so much money from these people they don't want to cut off or anger their cash cow. Anything to keep sucking on the golden teets of that creamy cash cow.

Simple put, the game is not worth buying or even worth playing right now and won't be until the devs step down from their loftly pillar they placed themselves upon and actually deal with real issues instead of high roading it and tossing ingame currency at players in a wastefull and insulting attempt to make us turn cheek. 

I won't be buying another game from these developers or anyone who had a hand in it's creation and won't consider changing my mind unless something is done.

Pros: 
1. A very accurate trajectory system. I know that most people won't notice that stuff, but as a programmer student I'm impressed. Hitting an above 100 meter shot with a sniper is so satisfying 

2. Good graphics. The game is somewhat beautiful even in Very Low settings. 

3. Variety of maps to play on (3 to be exact with the #15 patch).

4. Balanced weapons and loot system. AR's are reliable and SMG's are a way to a successful game. Loot is almost everywhere but it conflicts with you luck (Humour). 

5. The game is suprsingly fun when played with friends. 


Cons (oh boy) :

1. Terrible netcode. I don't know how I prevent myslef from smashing everything on my desk when I am fragging an almost perfect game only to get killed while I run towards a tree or a wall. 

2. Framerate. I currently have everything on very low except anti-alaising (I know I wrote it incorrectly) and View distance which are on Medium. My specs are i3-4150/8GB ram/GTX 1050. My pc meets my purchase-date steam minimum requirements. Thought the game tends to drop below 30 fps when encoutering more players. 

3. Well this may not affect me but it is a problem as I never experienced this on the EU server. Hacking. I've seen a ton of videos about hackers in pubg and it's worse than everything I've ever seen. 

4. Sound. That may be my biggest problems. I rely heavily on sound when I game and I think it helps everyone to locate an enemy. This in pubg is almost absent. 

5. Lack of support. The latest patch brought us a paid event pass. Oh god. Everything you get from that is gonna disappear leaving you only 2 things (not to mention none of them is readable or marketable). 

This concludes a basic pros and cons list. Now my public opinion. Do not buy the game. You should only get it by a giveaway or free (Humour cause it will never be free). The devs simply don't care enough for the game nor the playerbase. They always try to milk more and more money from it. Little to nothing is being done for the game's optimization and rigidity (word?). The game as it is now should have been in the early access we say in March 2017. Period. I know that won't reach the devs but it will definitely influence a future buyer. Thanks for the time you spent to read this. Have a good day fellow gamer.

Playing this game with friends is fun but the same can be said about basically anything. The development of this game is an absolute cluster-fuck as well, since everything the devs have done since creating the game has either been to increase profit, or to try and combat Fortnite's obviously superior development team. 

""Oh fortnite has battle passes? Ok team lets do the same thing, only the cosmetics are temporary and it costs more""

""Why do people like fortnite? Must be the smaller map. Lets make a 4k x 4k map of our own""

""What was that? People like Fortnite because its fun and there is care put into it? Shit.""

Fortnite is so much more succesful because-- get this ****THEY CARE ABOUT THE GAME****. 

It's so obvious if you look at the games from a surface standpoint. Fortnite is free, it runs well on all consoles, PC, and mobile. And you have the choice to buy a Battle Pass or Vbucks for cosmetics, if you want. If you buy pubg youre already $30 in the hole, then they refuse to fix their game? With that much money you could but like 3 Battle Passes in FN and even earn more battle passes through PLAYING THE GAME. Even after all the profit PUBG so obviously make, they wont:

- Add proper map selection
- Optimize
- Fix the console performance
- Let you earn crates for free
- Fix the connection issues
- Stop the flow of hackers (very clearly from china (I'm not racist))

However if you and a group of friends drop money on this, there's a problem. You buy a game that has made promises that it didn't keep, support negligent corporate dbags and more. 

So in this game, there's no secret that there is a China problem. Many news outlets have picked up on this game's problem with Chinese players. Now, China is a huge country in terms of population. When this game got popular, a large portion of China started playing this game. Now, steam is no longer a primarily English speaking platform because of these people. That's great, right? So here's where the problem lies. There isn't enough servers for the Chinese players. Chinese players don't have enough servers to play on, so they overflow to North American and Oceania servers. This is a huge problem, because now we have people who don't speak the same language as the people on their native servers. This game is very dependant on communication, so without proper communication there is sure to be frustration. Also, since these people are in China, there ping is through the roof. Ping doesn't matter all that much in other game genres, but in FPS, having bad ping gurantees a bad game. These people have large delays between them and the servers, so if they got shot and downed by someone in North America, it might take a second for the damage to register on their computer in China, allowing the Chinese player a short window of time to kill their rival before the hit against them registers and they are downed. This is a huge problem for balancing. One last problem with the Chinese overflow is cheaters. Battleye, the service used to catch cheaters in this game, has tweeted that 99% of all cheaters in this game are from China. Catching cheaters isn't all that hard, all they have to do is prevent players from joining games if their files differ from the server's or if they are using a cheating program. So that would be an easy problem solved.

Here's the biggest issue of all issues. The creator of the game is fucking delusional. This guy believes he owns Battle Royale, and this guy will gladly screw someone over for a few bucks. In business, there is this phrase, ""If you shake someone's hands you'd better count your fingers."" and the creator of the game, Brendan Greene, fits extremely well to this phrase. Greene tried to copyright Battle Royale, something he did not create and completely plaigerized by saying he did. Greene REFUSES to ban cheaters from China because they arre a significant source of revenue. Greene REFUSES to region lock this game, so players from China won't get the upgrade from the shitty servers they have that they deserve, especially with the money this game is pulling in. For fuck's sake Greene, by banning cheaters and forcing them to buy a new copy, you'd be making money. How could you not see that? Also, Greene calls people like myself who say that there is a problem with Chinese players playing on the wrong servers Xenophobes. Mate, we're not racist. We couldn't give a flying fuck about what you look like. As long as you can speak the same language, have good ping, and have a good time, we're okay with it. The same goes for the rest of the world. Believe it or not, nobody likes cheaters, nobody likes it when people do things that are wrong, and nobody likes it when we get called racists and xenophobes for stating a problem that you refuse to fdix because you want money.

Let's see... I think i will keep this short. PUBG at its core can be a fun, competitive game. There have been a lot Ups and Downs. 

Let's start with the pro's:
- A fun solo or squad based shootem up with surving til the end being the goal
- 1 life. makes it all the more intense
- Variety of weapons and vehicles to move around
- And who doesnt enjoy free falling for a little while before using a chute to land.
- Random care packages from fly by's (a nice big shiny red crate with goodies)

and for the cons.
- poor optimisation.
- sometimes poor connectivity
- buggy lobby (sometimes have to restart the game entirely to fix)
- random Disconnects (had this happen only a few times)
- Driving is clunky and even the smallest rock has a good chance of stopping a 4WD (Arma anyone?)

Too sum it up in to this date. I've had good and bad experiences. yet as the weeks and Months go by. I'm enjoying this less and less due to one main factor that can be seen... cheaters and hackers.. while i do understand there are actions being taken to reduce and remove this particular issue.  it's become a large hassle and the issue is... needless to say. running rampant as per my experience 9/10 games have had a cheater or hacker using some sort of cheat to win. at this stage i do not reccomend getting this if you want to play competetive. but if you dont care and jsut want to mess around with friends regardless of what happens. sure that's still do able. this review is liable to change over time. as well as my opinion.

As for now though. Might be better to find another game to pass the time.

Update: so i Gave this a good time before coming back here to make any other comments. and. unfortunately... the game has only gotten worse with each update. I still dont recommend it and as a matter of fact. i even uninstalled it. the biggest issue still seems prevailant across the entire game.. hackers and cheaters.. new guns, the events. sure there fun.. but unless this cheater problem gets resolved on a large scale... i expect nothing but dissappointment from this game and will not likely go back to play ever again.",1528367063,1535247608,False,6,0,0.572785615921020508,0,True,False,False

4 months later the game is very popular due to streaming and asian cheaters all mainly from (CHINA) are flooding in, a statement is made by Blueballs stating they have banned over 1 Million accounts????....uhh okay

6 months in the cheating problem is out of control and there nothing that can stop them, devs can ban them but won't mac/ip ban them because they stand to make money out of them once again if they rebuy the game and continue cheating

I am all for them charging money to unlock the special streamer/parachute skins outright, but they have gone well beyond that with their greed.

There has always been the issue with locked crates.
-BP Crates, you often get locked crates with no other way to earn a key than paying $2.50 per key! you can't even buy keys with BP or earn them with chicken dinners. Even a daily log in rewards system with 1-2 keys a week would work in my opinion.

The biggest slap in the face however is the new levelling system.
YOU HAVE TO PAY $10USD to actually recieve levelling rewards?!?!?!?! for a game I have already paid $40 AUSD to play.
You also can't claim mission completion rewards without paying for the pass.
What a fucking joke.

With the massive amount of battle royale games being released, you'd think the Devs would want to reward their playerbase, not spit in their faces.

The Devs seem focussed on rapidly adding things to the cash store while their game remains plagued with hackers and bugs.

I start with Cons coz there are so many

- Cons

-> Poor Servers
-> Extermly poor Port from Arma 2 
-> Gun play is awful [Servers have a part to play]
-> Cheating is very wide spread
-> Microtransations [They would Rather make skins and cases instead of fix the game]
-> Graphically game is better than most but looks washed out and the use of the Unreal Engine is Poor
-> Lobby is still buggy as hell despite being in full
-> Weapon Balancing is heavy handed [Devs have no idea about 5.56 & 7.62]
-> Vaulting is slow and scripted
-> Hit Reg is god awful and feels the amount of Desync is unacceptable 
-> Game is sadly a walk with the blue cicle and pick of someone wow GG great camp gameplay

Pros

-> I can play with my friends 
-> Audio is good on some weapons and artilary
-> The Feel of a win is amazing

There arnt that many good points about this game...

It feels like a cash grab with loot boxes before they even fix the core...

This game is not E-sports ready [FIX THE GOD DAM LAG]

Let alone having all Asian players in every match that kill you, this game has a huge problem as of today.

I am not putting hard work and time into a game only to be rewarded with a crate you want me to open my wallet to unlock. I thought PUBG was made by people who didn't care about being money hungry, hence the cheaper price tag but it has now become a classic case of bait and switch with the implementation of paid crates, an idea that is getting really old in the gaming community. I will not support any company who is so greedy for money they do something like this obviously despite players wishes. You have already made so much money from selling the game even though it is cheaper than most other games this is just the real creators of the game exposing their greedy nature at the taste of cash. Are you deliberately trying to ruin this game? Have you not been paying attention to current events and what has happened with EA trying to implement RNG gambling into their game? I have always been a huge fan of PUBG and recommended it to every friend (but no longer) and spent countless hours playing but I (along with other players who are against this) will not play another second of the game until this is fixed.

--------------------------------------------------
POSITIVE:
-You can have a lot of fun in this game solo or with friends.
-On the early access you could earn more money than the game price.
-There is FPP and TPP.
-There is not only one single map. There is 2 maps.
-There is voice chat so that you can communicate with your Teamates.
-There is cool skins which you can get every week if you are playing enough to get BP (Battle Points).
NEGATIVE:
-The game is really bad optimized
-It has ridiculous mechanics
-Spectating mode has many bugs
-A lot of hackers (70% of games im killed by hackers).
-Really high price.
-Bad graphics for 2017 game.(GTA V has better graphics[2013])
-A lot of bugs and glitches.
-There is hardly any loot on the second map.
-There is server lag almost every game.

This game is great... and can be tons of fun!!  Sure it has some bugs, but the thrill and adrenaline rush you get from it is one of a kind.  There are other games like it, but the unique blend of elements make it truly stand out!  So why am I giving it a thumbs down?  

Because Asians have completely destroyed this game.  Now, before you think I'm some type of ignorant racist that wants to ""Make PUBG Great Again,"" let me explain.   Asians have the highest volume of hackers in this game - a fact admitted by the devs.  ""But all games have hackers nowadays!"" you might reply.  True, they do, but the hackers in PUBG pose a twofold problem.  

[b]First[/b], the quantity of hackers in this game is astounding.  We're not talking like, every other game or so you run into some questionable people.  EVERY SINGLE TPP (third person perspective, a gameplay type) game has a plethora of hackers.  Not just one or two, but several.  With this game's awesome ability to replay game sessions, and follow anyone you want, you can verify this claim (and I will be at the end of this review)!

[b]Second[/b], because there are so many hackers, a giant swath of asians refuse to play on the asian region.... which means they end up on other regions... and don't bother speaking the language.  So, here you are playing a game where you MUST depend on squad communication to survive - that's literally the entire point of the game - and you can't, because the vast majority of the time, unless you're playing w/a premade group of 4, you will be stuck w/Asians shouting out sounds that mean nothing to you.... on English regions.  

So you say, ""who cares, sounds fun!""  [b]Let me introduce you to your new squad!![/b]
[list]
[*] Best case scenario, they know a few English phrases and try to be a part of the squad.  I've met a few cool ppl this way!
[*] Average scenario, they shout in their native language, drowning out all other sound, and yell ""FAK U MADO"" (eff your mother), because they know what they're doing, don't care, and revel in making your experience absolute dog poo.
[*] Worst (and also common) case scenario, they wait until you get a decent loadout... and then kill you, take your stuff, and team up w/other squads that they link up w/through discord.
[/list]

[b]Finally[/b], to bring everything back around to the twofold problem.  If that many Asians are already joining other regions because of hackers in their own region.... do you think that stops the hackers?? ROFL.. of course not.  So at the end of the day, every game you play will contain Asian hackers, and the vast majority of games you play will also put you in a squad of toxic people you can't understand.

As promised, here's a terribly put together video of exaclty what you're going to experience, every time you play this game in TPP:

People expected you to region lock china like a year ago, but apparently you decided to lock region to china, for EU players. From 50 ping to 130 ping without any option to choose a server? Seriously?

+ fun to play with friends, as long as none of the following BUGS (or features? whatever)...

- the netcode of this game is REALLY BAD - when shooting a shotgun from point blank (ZERO) distance, the enemies sometimes (very often!) don't die - whie yourself die from a shotgun from (while having a LVL 2 vest and helmet) about 50 metres - which is ridiculous!! It can make a player so f***** mad! Especially when game runs well and after the whole pregame, flight and some looting one dies by this stupid bug (which has to be one - since according to the damage list, a shotgun should not be able to kill a player with ONE shot! It is annoying - devs pls get some brains and fix this...

- When fighting some people and you run behind a wall (massive - solid rock!), you can die 2-3 secs after that - lag?  whatever it is... fix that! Or dont name this game 1.0 - when the actual code is still in the BETA.

- What is the deal that a player CAN NOT chose what MAP he wants to play? You want to force players to play the stupid Miramar map, even if a player doesnt like it and wants to play Erangel? What is wrong with you guys? Let the player chose, or people will just re-ready the games and these will not be full as it is supposed to be.

- What is the deal with the fps drops? Game doesnt look that amazing that it would require a high-end PC. Super Mario looks better than some of these ****** graphics and it runs on NINTENDO. Please get some good programmers and optimize the code, would be much appreciated!

All in all: 

Fun game to play, but is still in the state of BETA - because of all the bugs and game behaviour - expecially hitboxes and shotgun, which is AWFUL.

Pros:
It is the only ""not absolutely indescribably garbage game"" in a battle royale style. 
Is it better than H1Z1? Yes. Is it better than DayZ, a game that was literally abandoned by its devs? Yes.

Is it a good game that warrants you spending $30 on it? No. Depending on your mileage, it could be a perfectly fine experience where you feel no stutters, no lag, no (objectively) poor net performance (see Battlenonsense on YouTube for this), no [b]absolutely trash hitbox[/b] experiences. But if you look at how many negative reviews there are, you're unlikely to be so fortunate. So let's get to-

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Worst Multiplayer FPS netcode on Earth
This is not an exaggeration. You are running on 20-tick servers. To put this in perspective, try tinkering with the visual settings of any game to get your framerate down to 20fps. This is what the server sees at any point in time. To contrast this, CS matchmaking sees players competing on 64-tick servers - which most players still complain about, which is why competitive players play on 128-tick third party servers. 

    [*]Worst optimization on Earth
This is maybe a little bit of an exaggeration. If you can afford a 1080 (at 1080p) or a 1080ti (at 1440p) - in other words, the best of the consumer best, then you will run this game -adequately-

    [*]Worst hitboxes on Earth
In my experience, this is honest-to-God truth. Here are some examples of my own experiences of hits that were not considered Headshots (screenshots taken at 120 fps ish, taken at the frame of firing)
1. https://imgur.com/47yTmtc
2. https://imgur.com/IUgXlpo
    [*]Really terrible sound design
Sometimes you'll hear people from miles away, other times they're right on top of you and you don't hear a peep
    [*]Cheaters amok
It's not always super obvious speed hacking, sometimes it's nearly-as-super-obvious zero recoil SKS auto firing at 200m with iron sights hitting each shot. 
[/olist]

I can honestly go on and on. This is a **** poor game. It's a terrible game. It is a terrible game, that is played by 20 million people because it is the only one currently of its kind. 

So if you're the kind of person who loves paying insurance simply because there is no other option to having it, you may enjoy PUBG.

There is of course a case to be made against me here: I have 300+ hours on a game, doesn't that itself make it worthwhile? Surely if it was that bad, I wouldn't spend 300+ on it? And that is partly true, but don't forget, again, there is no alternative. While it works well enough to sometimes enjoy and the idea is cool, it doesn't mean it's a recommendable game in a recommendable state. If DotA or Counter Strike was this poorly created, it would not be getting positive reviews and it would still be played because there is nothing quite like it. So that's the final point. There is nothing like PUBG, which means I begrudged it 300+ hours of playtime. And still is it one of the worst games I have played in recent memory.

[b]The truth is[/b]:
You don't have to buy this game. It's becoming an insanely popular *style* of game that will shortly see an abundance of options on the market.

And wait there is more, there is a PUBG championship and stuff. Hold on, the game can't even be played properly and you expect to make money. You guys are too hasty for this game.

Honestly, as a game developer, this where you guys should stop. Look at everyone review of this game, its very bad. There should be an evaluation for this game. Now, that's why every other game started to gain popularity. BECAUSE other similar games are FREE to play and working properly.

So, thanks for this game.

[h1] Heres why PUBG sucks: [/h1]

[b] Major Con, extreme amounts of looting in this game makes the game stale [/b]

When people play PUBG unfortunately they feel the need of having mods, gear, helmet, vest, meds and boosters in their inventory ARE necessary for their ability to play due to the wide variety of items and upgrades that can give you a mild advantage so naturally people want to take advantage of this and only engage when they have the right items which is fairly smart if you want to win however looking at the wide scope of things the amount of different items your going to want to have is huge for a battle royale game encouraging looting over fighting causing a stale gameplay experience. [b] For example [/b] if someone goes into a building and finds an M16 with some ammo, instead running and gunning and actively fighting others they will pick it up and go ""ok now I need a scope for it and a helmet and a vest and some meds and boosters and a stock and a silencer etc etc"" and ONLY after they loot all these items they are ready to fight. So what you get is at the beginning of the game, unless you are an active running and gunning player with that kind of mindset you will get absolutely stale gameplay running across the map and looting which in my experience takes up about 80% of a match. Although looting is an important aspect of any battle royale game, the primary focus of the game should be actively fighting each other and not looting! Even 20-30 minutes in people are still going to be looting beacuse of the extra little upgrades you can still get such as a level 3 vest compared to your level 1 or a silencer instead of a compensator etc, the wide variety of different items and modifications you can get has made people specifically go for and want to loot even more thus how the game is intentionally or unintentially primarily focusing the looting aspect of PUBG and giving people this looting mindset of disengaging from fights and finding more loot makes a stale match. This is what makes PUBG boring, a hiding and running looting fest, the only parts of an average match which I genuinely find exciting and fun is either in the final few circles where everyone is out there to find and fight each other which I admit really does get my adrenaline pumping or at the very beginning, landing in a highly populated area where there is an active threat and looting takes as a secondary focus. Unfortunately these heart pumping moments where I feel like im scared for my life only take up no more than 20% of the game if youre lucky, the rest of it is a boring, stale, unexciting loot fest. 

[h1] Heres why fortnite is superior [/h1]

The looting system and the way people play Fortnite is much simplier and honestly so much more fun. This is because of the lack of items people deem necesarry to fight with. The moment you land in fortnite and you see a green shotgun for example (a relatively common item in the game) is all you need and your good to go and can literally run and gun around the area and engage in killing people with no problem. Sure there are other items in the game that can come in handy but not nearly as much as you would need in PUBG as you dont necessarily need a shield potion for the early game or even possibly end game of fortnite at all as I've won many matches without it and meds dont have nearly as much of a severe impact on the game as in PUBG as typically fights are much more close ranged giving bandaging up in fights almost futile. All you need in fornite is a decent gun and youre okay, no silencers, no scopes, no armour pieces, no bullsh*t.

This is what makes a battle royale game fun.

[h1] Side Cons of PUBG compared to Fortnite [/h1]

-PUBG is notoriously poorly optimised, even players with good PC's exceeding the system requirements have unenjoyable performance issues. Fortnite runs perfectly if you meet the system requirements.
-PUBG is $40 NZD compared to Fortnite being free

[h1] Side Pros of PUBG [/h1]

-Biggest Battle Royale Game out there, huge community almost everyone owns it so it can be a good conversation starter for those awkward moments irl if the other person has played or even heard of PUBG (likely)  :)
-Turning in a questionable Esport??
-Made my money back from selling crates although I owned the game for a while now when the Gamescom Crates came out and selling the normal cases at a higher price soo

After the 10 month I played PUBG I can say that I cant recommend it anymore.

While the game itself is quite solid it has serious flaws. First of all would be the net-code with a horrible tickrate that makes many encounters a roll of the dice. You could play with a 300ms ping and it would not make a difference due to the slow refresh time between server and client. I waited a long time to see if this would be subject to change but apperantly it is not.
This brings us to the next point, the absurd idea to store hits and other information on the client-side which makes it very easy for cheaters. Both issues are most likely causes by the design idea to save some money on server-side as the client could take part of the tasks but with the result of an unacceptable tickrate.
While this decision is understandable at the the beginn of development due to lacking of funds it could be changed by now as bluehole was flooded with money.

Next in line would be the design ideas to add microtransactions which can be frowned upon or not but I disgust any buy-options, seasons-passes or other stuff in a game which I paid 30 bucks for.
Last but not least would be the evergrowing gap between community and developer as for example it was officaly stated that all feedback within steam would not be taken into consideration for any design ideas.

So all in all I conclude from my point of view that PUBG is getting milked for money while the game itself is recieving very little new content. This little content is then celebrated like a rockstar by the devs while it is basically nothing when compared to development progress of other games. I have the fear that the distribution of money to critical development areas as well as the company structure is seriously flawed which will lead the game further to ruin.

Even though early access ended and the game had a offical ""launch"" it is in my opinion not out of the beta phase from the quality of the game.",1532067172,1532527909,False,4,0,0.569536387920379639,0,True,False,False

For a battle royale, one of the best. The addition of the team deathmatch gamemode was also nice. Helped spice up the game, add some variety. Gun physics, somewhat accurate, difficult to master quickly. Overall, a very good concept, 
- Game Performance: Getting Better. For a game that started where it started, it's definitely improved tenfold over the beta/early access/whatever version of the game. However, a concern all players have is definitely how slow they are to keep optimizing the game. The time spent to develop emotes, extra crates, and the goddamn fucking Sanhok-fortnite-ripoff-money-grab-event, is completely useless. Not to mention trying to take everything from Fortnite that is different from PUBG, because Fortnite is ""more popular"". Not to mention trying to sue Epic Games in the meantime for copying. Brendan Greene, you didn't invent battle royale buddy. Not to defend fortnite, but it's a totally different game, just the same genre. If Valve tried to sue Activision just because CS:GO is similar to COD, it'd be pretty stupid. So stop spending all your time trying to regain your players, and trying to rip them off for money + making a useless lawsuit, and give your players what they want; an optimized game.
- Customer Support: Absolute Fucking Garbage. Contact PUBG Corp about a problem you have, and they send an automated reply saying the same thing: Whatever the fuck you have an issue with, we cannot change it because of the way that it is. Okay, so I might've teamkilled a few of my squad members as jokes, and we 'report' each other sometimes as a joke, or because it was deserved. Either way, it got me banned. Now mind you, I didn't think it was a big deal, you could contact support and get your account unbanned with the logical and reasonable explanation. Nope. PUBG Corp fucks you in the ass. Vigorously. Sorry Player, your account has had an infraction on it, we cannot remove it because it's been applied.  We hope this helped :) Enjoy your PUBGless life. Well, that was a waste of how many hours and $37 CAD. So as a retard I tried to give it another try. After many times trying to contact support, I was kindly gifted the game again on a separate account. (Which I still have to pay back, my deepest apologies Monty.) Fast forward to one hour into the game. BANNED. Again. No reason, just an almost instant ban. Now, a waste of 2 peoples money. Again, after multiple attempts of contacting PUBG Support, the same automated response; Sorry player, we can't do this as you're banned. In terms of helping customers, by far the worst support team out there.
- UPDATE: recently there was a notice about PUBG giving compensation to accidentally banned players. Hearing about this, I reinstalled the game to check if I was part of that list. Nope. Another ticket to PUBG. Another fucking degenerate response. ""This only applies to people who were accidentally banned. We noticed you've been banned, so this does not apply to you."" Thanks :) makes 100% sense and helped us waste $74 CAD. I would recommend this game, however the way they disregard players and their concerns makes me change my mind.",1530062995,1530062995,False,4,1,0.569482266902923584,0,True,False,False

Myths about ""Cheater's Battlegrounds!"":
 
1. FFP has less hackers

It is absolute BS, hack software for PUBG works in every mode, hence there are almost the same amount of hackers in every mode. A lot of them cheating smart and staying dormant till the last stages of the game. Believe me or not is your choice.

2. Too many tickets PUBG support cannot cope with

Another BS. I have worked in game support before. Every time we have too much tickets to process, we have just outsourced a part of them to another company to reduce the burden for in-house support dep. Considering how much money BH gets for selling PC copies and after entering into Chinese market, outsourcing part of the tickets to third-party is not an issue at all with all these resources they have right now.

The only reason they do not do it and not interested in solving hack software and cheaters issue is money flow. Everyone is happy:

- Devs getting money from copies;

- Creators of hacks getting money from renting their hack software for 30$ per month (more or less);

- Cheaters (if they smart enough) getting money from selling crates and getting joy by owning you in every match. Also, there is a tricky way to own you and lose nothing after account is banned in the process. They are buying a new game, playing with cheats on, then refunding it using 2 PCs before it gets banned, then cycle repeats;

- Lucky draw sites getting money from crates and loot lotteries;

- ""Helpers"" - getting money after selling stolen Steam accounts (you can see messages in Chinese starting with 解封, that means ""help in unbanning your account"", if you stupid enough to believe them, you will lose your account).

You, player, the only loser in this game, unless you cheat as well.

Battlegrounds is a game that has found meteoric success over the last few months attracting millions of bloodthirsty players ready to fight to the death, but not all of them want to play by the rules. Depending on who you ask PUBG either has a serious hacking problem that affects every game or cheaters are barely noticeable, rare unicorns witnessed every one hundred games or so. Whichever side of the fence you sit on, PUBG has banned roughly tens of thousands of hackers in the last three months, so they're certainly out there. You may very well have played with a hacker, but the truth is you'd never know it, if the hacker slowly stalked you using ESP, an ability that grants the cheater extra sensory perception of your location at all times. You'd just think you were unlucky. You can't win every game after all.

Hacking communities are notoriously secretive and for obvious reasons, but this often leaves their motives shrouded in stereotypes. Common opinion paints them as vindictive children with too much time on their hands and a penchant for mischief, but surely they can't all be like that? Some of these hacks aren't cheap. 

So back to the game....

FPP or TPP?

My opinion on FPP vs. TPP: First off I prefer FPP over TPP. When it comes to watching I prefer, to watch FPP. The reason being is gameplay is more exciting. You can play more aggressively, higher kill games are more common. Gun skill becomes more a factor. People have to take risk to gain information in FPP, you can't just sit behind your cover and see everything that is happening around you. You have to understand when to peek, what directions to be watching. You can snowball fights, If I engage someone in FPP and damage them heavily, they either have to turn to fight me, or retreat to cover. If they retreat to cover they’re now blind to my movements, I can flank them, reposition and attack them from another angle. The enemy player after being caught off guard, or losing the initial engagement has to understand where I can move on him. He either needs to predict my movements, or take a risk to gain information by peeking, and then responding accordingly. If that same scenario happens in TP, as soon as the guy gets to cover he is safe. He can med, he can see all my movements, I can't push him. It becomes a stalemate. Whoever moves first more often than not will die in this situation. Gameplay is slowed down, and aggression is halted. There's way more action in FPP that's why I prefer watching it. There's a ton of game sense that comes into play in first. Since you don't have some camera floating up behind your character, with a super wide FOV. When it comes to what one is more skilled, both require a large amount of skill to do really well in at the highest level. At the end of the day when it comes to the more skilled mode, I have to give it to FPP though.",1514819737,1514819737,False,5,0,0.568345308303833008,1,True,True,False

Rather than fixing optimization issues, gameplay issues (IE: you can die right off the bat when parachuting into gameplay) as well as overall server lag/crashes, we see unnecessary content code being implemented, when the code itself is already flawed enough as is.

However, Fortnite became so popular, that it crushed PUBG's player count.

PUBG finally started to die, players leaving left and right from the devs not fixing simple problems, and insulting their own community by calling them ""Racist"" for wanting the foreign players to have their own servers.

Yes I have almost 1,800 hours in game. Yes I have been playing since week 1 (or something close to that). This game helped me through a lot of problems in my life, always giving me a fun game to go back to. I was a religious player, always standing by it through shit updates and terrible lags. As of the release of 1.0, things just really went down hill. The new map: shit, new driving mechanics: shit, AND THEY ALSO FUCKED UP PARACHUTING?? LIKE HOW THE FUCK? I love the game still, just in a differnt way; if that makes sense. PUBG Corp should get their shit together since in the past month, they have lost over 600,000 average concurrent players. 

If you havent played it; get it. If you are on the fence, try it out, as this game practically broke steam and the internet for a couple monthes and its worth seeing what the hype is about. Maybe I am just burned out, who knows. But for now, I really dont think I can reccommend this to anyone. 

To everyone that has a blast still in this game, hold on to that! The game on Erangel (old map) is honestly magical, especially in the first 500 hours, were you somehow STILL find new shit on the map. Just the 1.0 update really messed it up for me. 

This is my opinion, so if you don't like it, the buy it for yourself honestly. Reading reviews wont truely tell you how YOU feel about the game. But if it just so happens that a mature player looking to possibly buy this game and is reading reviews, then just beware of some of my warnings, since I have been here since week 1 and played religiously through now. Ive played every update, every gun, every map, EVERYTHING. Its still a great game in a way, but the original magic was really lost through PUBG Corps hunger for money and pushing XBONE version and Skins too early.",1519337206,1519337206,False,9,0,0.567075014114379883,0,True,False,False

Immersive, intense, action packed and gives you a sense of hope that this will be something great

Woods update behind Mansion location on Erangel was awesome! Sanhok is beautiful and fast paced! Miramar is a nice change of scenery.

Guns 'look' genuine!

ANTI-CHEAT seems to be working great!

Arguably better with friends ;)

--------------------------------

CONS:
Ruggered, rough, frustrating, unoptimized that feeling of hope slowly diminishing after major and annoyingly obvious issues are still present each week. Another sad case of devs seem more concerned about quick $ than creating a true masterpiece that would naturally generate $$$ for along time. Get your A into G bluehole.

Should not of left BETA. The PRE-CHRISTMAS cash grab for xbox was unsavoury, distasteful and disgusting!

Not a whole lot of uniqueness around the map seemingly most of it is copy & paste especially Erangel so much unused and repetitive buildings/spaces/environments.

Not alot of arsenal/attachment options/diversity for weapons and especially armor.

SKINS: Utilizes a gambling type system that feeds on losers, incredibly inappreciable chance of getting the unique skins while shoving colossal amounts of the same s**t into your inventory.

--------------------

HOPES:

Would L0VE a HARDCORE FP mode, No UI, no player kill confirm/count/killfeed, increased bullet damage, stamina and magazine management.

Pretty please make VSS spawn with either a PSO-1 scope (sniping) or a OKP-7 (CQB combat)

Hopes night matches will not be broken. Attachable flashlights/laser designator to guns? Night vision in crates? (night vision goggles give off a green glow faintly seen by other players paying attention so they wouldn't be OP)

Hopes campaign/story and zombie modes being refreshing and different.


--------------------

Game is definitely worth buying almost endless fun/frustration.

Don't get me wrong. It's a lot of fun especially when playing in a squad with three friends and solid communication but the negative aspects definitely outweigh the positive ones. I guess Pubg's biggest problem is the core engine. It runs like shit even on high end rigs, the lag is horrible, a anti-cheat engine doesn't really exist (at least it feels like that), and this hasn't changed in over half a year. When I bought the game I told myself that it was early access, so some bugs are tenable but since it launched version 1.0 I feel like the game gets gradually worse with every update. Instead of addressing glaring bugs and non-existent optimization the dev team rather incorporates more cosmetic items, emotes that don't work, and keys that you can buy for real money to open loot boxes. Of course, they also updated the game in some aspects to benefit the player, like adding a new map and overhauling weapons but in the end there is just too much negative with the game than there is positive. I will probably still play the game and even enjoy some matches, but I can't recommend the game to anyone in it's current state.

There's a reason #RegionLockChina is a hashtag. Google it and you'll just scratch the surface of how bad this problem is in PUBG. Hacking is nothing new to online gaming, but when it gets out-of-control, and the developer CHOOSE TO DO NOTHING about it, then the game becomes unplayable.

For the past six months, this game has been plagued with hackers; mostly from China. BattleEye tweets that they can ban upwards of 40,000 hackers a day. FORTY THOUSAND!!!  You would think that PUBG devs wold take action? Nope! PUBG devs can easily region lock Chinese players & hackers on their own server to try to minimize the plague on the community.. But they choose not to.  PUBG devs ignore all the facts & evidence and blame ""xenophobia"" for players wanting a region lock.  Yes, you heard that correctly, ""xenophobia"". Google that too (PUBG & Xenophobia).  

So rather than region locking the game or aggressively going after hackers, the PUBG devs have chosen to call millions of their own customers xenophobic, and allow hacking to run rampant.

The menu itself is already a highly intensive area because if I Alt-Tab out to check on something and try to tab back in, I wouldn't be able to because the game will freeze and die and I have to open up task manager to end task to close it rather than pressing the X button on the window on my taskbar.

It'll be considered a violation and you can receive a ban if the game detects it but it'll be blocked anyway according to videos on the LowSpecGamer and on PUBG's update notes.

CPU: 2.3GHz Intel Core i7-3610QM

Spent 160+hr playing this game.
Hands down, this is one of the most ""editable"" MMO TPS.
Enjoy the unleashed imagination of human beings!

Pros:
>Get to see Superman, flying boats, and possibly your favorite super ability in this game!
>Enjoy myriads of dying possibilities including Death Star kills!
>Cheat and not getting banned 12/10
>Get rekt by glitches (AND GET BANNED AS A GLITCH VICTIM)!
>Crash after a few rounds (no refunds for your lost work)!

Cons:
None! This game is ""awesome""!

Donate $29.99 to charity to help the world rather than wasting them here with HAAAAAX lol

It is fun, yes it is. Especially when you play with your friends. Its undeniable.
PUBG got so much good potential but idk why but they just can't bring those potential to life and give us a good experience.

The game itself is broken from the inside, if you have a potato internet and PC I suggest don't even try this game, because in my experience, in any resolution or texture I play the game only give me 30-50 or less fps. 

But the choices are all yours. 
If you up to play countless dead, and wanna eat some chicken at the end with maximum effort its all yours. Or you just wanna kill those guys with weapon you like from the game, or you just wanna be the guy that survive without even try to take those weapon because you are 'pacifist'.

For me, the gameplay is okay but if you not really good at it, its not that fun. And it take so much time to them to add another mode in PUBG.

- Netcode is garbage
- Devs do not care about netcode. Literally games that came out 10 years ago had better netcode.
- Hitreg/damage calculation are pure garbage
- Server syncs/desyncs (you can clearly see that in the killcams)
- You can kill people by shooting in the air like you just dont care
- Vertical recoil and weapon precision is a joke. It is so high it clearly disadvantages low DPI players. I play on 450 in 1080p. It is very hard, if not impossible to control the recoil in full auto in most cases.
- People use recoil control software with their mouse and macros for auto shooting in semi, which greatly improves their accuracy.
- Hackers
- Cancer playberbase much (voice chat permanently off for me)
- Sniper rifle headshot a character wearing a LVL2 helmet and the player still lives? Broken hitboxes along with desyncs do wonder.
- Overpriced
- Plenty of small useless updates every day

Pros:
- Decent graphics
- Cool gamemode
- Can play with up to 3 friends
- Keybind menu is nice

Devs need to:
Fix netcode and desyncs, balance recoil, effective ranges and damages. 

Eventually the ""boss"" will spend a fraction of the millions he earned to make this game great. Or not. Hiring a few network experts for at least a couple of months would be highly beneficial.

The chinese really ruin the experience since there are so many of the losers crapping up the NA servers with all their garbage. 

Blue hole is hurting itself in non chinese markets by not protecting them from the hackers and exploiters. They even admit that ""the vast majority of hackers"" are chinese, but it would be unfair to region lock them to their own servers so they can have ""fun"" hacking and cheating there instead of on NA servers.

I would not reccomend this game until they region lock the chinese to their own servers and stop punishing everyone else with the chinese shenanigans and cheats.

The only way I would reccomend this is if you have multiple other friends willing to team up with you, it is fun with friends, but still enraging, just slightly less so.

If you want to play a BR and actually have fun without your vehicles killing you every few games, keep far away from this game.
Many broken promises from PUBG Corp have proven that they don't care about their players and are just here for the money grab. It was promised there would be no skins in early access for example.
It might be a fully released game by statement of the devs (that is up to debate tbh, it's actual state is far from that) but skins were actually released in early access, with development speed still being slow. Makes you think where all the record breaking sales money went.

So in conclusion: Keep away, get an actual AAA title with Blackout. Easy as that.

i bought this game back in november,back then my config was r9390x and i5 6500.i used to enjoy this game despite of it being broken.constant bugs,unstable server,desync,innumerable stutters e.t.c.i didnt used to bother all the problems and bugs and i used to forgive them since it was on early access.it left ealry access still no development.so i upgraded my  pc 4 mnths ago to a gtx 1060 6gigs and i5 8400 and i blv its quite decent of a rig.and if this rig isnt enough,nobody should play this stupid ass game.i thought htis time i could get rid of all the stutters bcz i assumed my cpu was bottlenecking .despite the performance did improve by the number of fps but the issues of constant stuttering is still there and by dayes the qualit of this game is deterioting at a pace faster than usain bolt.
and for the past month its been almost impossible playing this game.i died almost everytime i landed and why??not bcz i cznt play.bcz the game froze for about 2 to 3 seconds constanlty which resulted in death.i am always facing stuter whenver  i ads,whenever i take a shot and fucking teleporting.
this game in  the worse possible ever.its even in worse state than early access.
it will take infinte time to note all the bugs and issues with this game since there are infinite.

i am ashamed of myself that i made myself a puppet of brenden green and blue balls entertainment. i am sick of being decieved and played by brenden green and blueballs entertainment. i am sick of all the people who are not abondoning this game so that they can be taught a lesson . brenden and blueballs are nothing but literal cash grabbers.they hardly put any effort to develop this game.the only thing they can do is whine about the success of fortnite,fyi i never played fortnite but still gonna say fortnite is far better game than pubg.
i sometimes doubt that monekyes are the actual developers of this game but later on revise myself saying that monkeys would have done a better job than them.

Trust me, I don't really write reviews, and I never thought I was going to be making one. However, when I saw there was a 12 GB update, and people still complained of problems from Early Access, it makes you wonder if Bluehole/PUBGCorp/Whoeverisinchargeofthisgame actually takes the time to see what the community wants.

Do not buy this game if you're not willing to deal with the bugs and problems from this very well made, and optimised game.
[list]
[*] You require a NASA Supercomputer to actually be able to render the houses before you're shot into a pulp, because nothing ever renders on time in this game.
[*] Picking up weapons is actually a chore in this game. Sometimes it works, sometimes your character reaches down to grab nothing, it's really a great feature if you ask me
[*] Terrain doesn't render properly sometimes, disappearing in the background. This would be fine if it was a small CS:GO Map or something, but this is a 16sqkm map with ~100 people. If my bullet hits invisible geometry, how much does that tell about a game?
[*] Bluehole is a very [b]Greedy[/b] company. I've seen many people say Valve is the most greedy company, but Bluehole takes the cake. They push out DLC, even though the game is debatably as bad as it was before the 1.0 Update. They also changed how getting free crates work. You gather BP, waste time and effort, and you get a paid crate. Why? Because they lowered the chances of getting FREE CRATES. Bravo! Great Community Outreach, Bluehole! You're giving what the community really want and need, microtransactions!
[*] The tickrate on this game is a joke. As much as I hate it, Fortnite has a constant tickrate, albeit low, but you can actually kill someone in the beginning of the game. PUBG's joke 60 tick servers barely allows you to run at the beginning of the game, and actually dips down to the 20 tick range. I'd actually rather play COD, It's quick, fun, and I don't have to worry about my sprint or jump being canceled, or my shots not hitting because of crap servers. Most of the time, you won't know if you're lagging or the server is taking a poop.
[*] Bluehole doesn't seem to actually check reported bugs, or even play test the map. Getting killed because of someone exploited inside of a giant rock in the middle of the desert isn't my kind of fun, but it seems like they also didn't take the time to polish their newest map, leaving in invisible walls, one way walls, and bullet-blocking leaves. (And more exploitable giant rocks.)
[*][b] It's been a year and there's still no training map. Why does a game that is released as a parody have a training mode, compared to an all-serious, esports ready game, that has weapon recoil to be accounted for doesn't?[/b]

I used to play a lot of this game, it was one of the only games that could fill the void in my heart that Dayz mod left and Standalone failed to fill. Now to start this review off I will say I definitely got my $30 out of this game. At it's core it is a fun game. So why the negative review? Because Bluhole/PubgCorp have continually made terrible design choices, have failed to fix problems that have plagued this game for months, make promises then break them and have more than once prematurely launched a broken patch into the game.

Lets talk about the microtransaction system. Crates! Lots of them! Some of them are free which is nice, most of them aren't. But you can't even choose if you want a free crate or premium. You get what you are given. Hey do you want that item that looks real nice? Well too bad! You are going to have to either spend $2.50 on a crate and hope you have that %0.5 that you'll get it out of the crate, or you are going to spend $100 on the steam market to buy it. Can you honestly tell me that any cosmetic in this game is worth over $100?

What about a progression system? Nope. The game has leaderboards that show exactly where you match up with other players. That resets every month. Is there a reason to strive to get to the top? no. The leaderboard resets are too often so it doesn't feel like you aclomplish anything by getting to the top. Also zero rewards for doing so. As I am writing this Pubg corp are implementing a new Battlepass system stolen from Fortnite. 10 Dollars, 30 levels, 24 cosmetics (8 of those are only wearable for the season and you dont even get to keep them), 4 weeks.  Is it weird that fortnite which is a free to play game also offers a 10 Dollar battle pass that not only has more content but lasts for 6 weeks longer? It's even weirder that games used to offer these progression systems for free almost 10 years ago? Even games like League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm that not only already offered seasonal ranked rewards, even changed their progression systems to give free to play players things that you could only previously buy with money. 

Optimisation is in the trash. My game seems to run worse with every patch. I don't know why. They do say they're working on it. But you want to know what's in the latest patch? Another crate! Sick. This game has so many glitches, which would be fine if this were an early access game. But it isn't. They entered a 1.0 release before the end of last year. They promised to leave 'early access' by the end of 2017. But the game is less functional now then it was before that major update. The main menu UI for the longest time didn't work, The OCE server matchmaking is still broken, Desync is now a problem, hit registration is still broken somehow. Maybe some of these wouldnt be so bad if i could just check my ping to the server. It is so obvious that you are trying to hide the fact your server performance is so bad that there isnt any way to check my ping in game. This is a feature that has been in every multiplayer game from the early 2000's onwards.

Have you heard that they are hard pushing this game as an Esport? I'm sure you've heard of the meme ESPORTS READY by now. Except it's not a meme, it's nuts that this game in the state it's in could hold tournaments. But they do, and if your client fails to connect, your bike gets hardstuck into a rock and you explode, your gun fails to shoot when you click or your shots fail to register. You bet that you are gonna be upset about missing out on that prize money.

Look, I could go on about all the things wrong with this game but there is one thing that is so much worse than all the things i have mentioned before. It's that it didn't have to be this way. In the first few months of early access, there were weekly (then bi-weekly) patches that fixed the games bugs and performance with a new gun or scope here and there. The game had kicked H1Z1 of the Battle Royale throne. It was king. So what happened? Cosmetics happened. They got a taste for the loot box craze and realized they could make more money pumping out clothing and gun skins than they could actually fixing the game. Now a game that was originally a base building wave survival game that pivoted has taken it's place. Had the development team of PUBG spent more time strengthening the foundations of the game it could be one of the greats. But it didn't, with every bad decision Bluehole/PUBG Corp and Playerunknown himself (Brendan Greene) make it is so transparent that they plan on to milking this game for every dollar they can squeeze out until it is truly dead.",1529579224,1529579566,False,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

Personally I think the game needs a big bug fix and optimization because running this on a potato pc makes you feel tricked by paying 29.99€ on a game that performs poorly with 20 fps.
I'm still waiting for Bluehole to finally get things going and make some good changes such as bug fixes and fps optimization as I metioned. 
But the thing is that instead of using all of this huge amount of money that they've earned, they are jumping on Fortnite and trying to sue them.

Networking in general is not exactly reliable, how many things implemented are questionable- the higher your ping is, the harder it is to heal inside a moving vehicle, which should be a completely server-side thing.

The test server seemingly has no real purpose, no matter how broken an update is it will still get pushed to the live servers.

I would not recommend the game until the servers perform consistently, the gameplay-critical elements are purely server-authoritative and the random stuttering, asset streaming and input latency issues that keep returning after updates are permanently fixed. It feels like the game servers are being hosted on the cheapest AWS server solution, despite Unreal Engine 4 requiring quite a bit of single-threaded performance to run properly, given its underlying design not being a modern data-oriented architecture, but a bloated object-oriented model with reflection bloat and such.

Pros 
- Can be addicting. 
- No such thing as an overpowered weapon 
- Game looks nice for right now. 
- Nothing game breaking (except for the fucking cars) 
- Very fun with a friend. 


Cons

- Textures sometimes don't load quick enough, causing gameplay issues. 
- Vehicles are fucking broken. 
- Landing sometimes flings you away from where you are (very rarely) 
- Landing on the ground sometimes spawns you in the air causing you to take damage. 
- The acog scope on the Kar98k and the AKM are absolutely disgusting. 
- Game does randomly lag for no reason 
- too many hackers 
- too many people switching reigons and abusing their high ass ping 
- Killing streamers gets you banned 
- Half the time you're running around the map like a retard
- If you do encounter someone the fight lasts for 1 - 2 minutes 


Honestly, I added a little extra for the Pros for no reason. There isn't really anything good about this game and there are a lot of things wrong with this game. I believe if they decided to actually fix the server and reigon lock people the game would actually be better. I honestly am disgusted by how many hackers and/or people switching over to the server I'm playing on and abusing their high ass ping.

The game generally plays just fine and is fun to play both as solo, and with a group of friends however there is an inherent and very obvious problem in which i'm convinced the devs don't care about, and that's the cheaters. We can try to sugar coat or twist the truth an infinite number of ways, but the stats don't lie and the majority of the cheaters ARE from China and IT IS A PROBLEM! 

Now, to prove my point that cheating is a HUGE problem in this game, I din't take anyone else's word for it, but rather i did an experiment myself. Every time I got killed in a game, i would watch the death cam carefully and determine whether the kill on me was legitimate skill or due to cheating. I even counted kills that i wasnt sure about as legitimate. I kept  arecord fo 100 deaths and noted which deaths were legitimate and which ones were due to cheaters. Of this sample size of 100 games, 76 out of 100 deaths were due to cheaters. So for OC servers at least, you have a 3 in 4 chance (76%) of encountering and/or being killed by a cheater. This is absolutely HORRENDOUS!

The fact that the number of cheaters and bans is actually INCREASING over time instead of decreasing should be a very clear indicator to the development team that they literally have no idea whatsoever on how to implement and fix their anti cheat system (if you can even call it that). Will region locking solve the issue?...... probably not. Will anything the developers do at this point solve the issue...... unlikely. It's clear that as long as the cashflow keeps coming in that nothing needs to be done. China is BY FAR the biggest market for PUBG and it's disappointing that a game develpment team whose game is, and has been out of the alpha and beta stages for ages now is being overrun by cheaters. make no mistake.... all our complaints about cheaters HAVE been heard and it's obvious they are completely ignored. 

I personally don't think banning over 1 MILLION cheaters in a month is an accomplishment, but a DISGRACE to the game!!! The fact that the anti cheat is that crap and it took them that long to finally ban such a vast number of players shows the lack of care for the game and consumers.

Quite frankly, I think the only way to solve the cheating problem is to fire the current developers who work on anti-cheat and start fresh with a new team who actually knows what the hell they are doing, and who can help the game survive in the long run.

While the game itself is amazingly fun when you are against legitimate players and even get that first Chicken Dinner, I cannot recommend this game in its current state, as spending all that time looting to get your suppressed M4 and Kar98 only to be killed by a cheater is honestly the most crushing feeling you can experience in a game. What a disappointment and disgrace....

1) This game is overrun by hacking players.

There is little point in trying in the final four when one of those people will win 100% of the time. BlueHole has done nothing to address this, going so far as to even admit that the majority of the hacking is coming from China. Rather than Region-Locking the servers, BlueHole seems more than content to allow the rampant cheating to continue. Their silence on the matter speaks volumes. 

2) Technical issues. Falling through the map. Wonky parachute landings. Cars and motorcycles achieving orbit. All of these things can kill a round for you. Hit detection feels absolutely random at times. 

3) New dependence on microtransactions for Crates. Unlocked a new crate? Awesome! That'll be $2.50 for a key to actually access the contents within. That's a lot of audacity on BlueHole's part for them to be pushing for this, considering the issues in my first two points.

Y'see children, in the year 1979, Communist China was struggling with the massive population growth it had just recieved, and had massive difficulty rationing out their food. To prevent further growth, China set up a ""one child policy"", one that enforced Chinese families (with exceptions, specifically to minorities, or if the first child was a girl for reasons I'll explain later) could only have ONE (1) child per family. For the families that didn't have children yet, but wanted them, they would now have to make a decision: Girl, or boy?

Y'see, China has culturally preferred boys to be born, rather than girls, namely seeing them as the ultimate workhorse fit for the task of providing for the family when the parents enter old age. Girls could still work, but weren't as seen as reliable, oh those ol' Chinese and their outdated ways! ""But what happened to the girls?"" You might ask, because we all know that you can't (not yet anyway) pick 'n mix, only God or Science can do that! Well, just sit down on ol' pappa's lap and let him explain in the simplest way possible.

They killed them.
Infanticide against female babies skyrocketed. Girls were shamed out of their families or had ""accidents"" so that families could make room for a beautiful, healthy, baby BOY. Suck on that fat one, Tumblr fem dykes.

""How the fuck does this relate to PUBG you fuck?"" No need to get cranky, theres still a bit to go before we can get to that.

Now, this one child policy has led the men to outnumber the women 20 to 1. Only the wealthy or lucky would even bother keeping a girl around. So many boys, so few girls. Can you guess what happens next?
Im okay with saying my sex-life is dry, but these people, whoo! Even relationships turned into a competition as guys fought tooth and nail for a chance at some puss. You have the winners and the losers, we already know about the winners so lets focus on the losers.

As one might expect, to get away from this dreadfully depressing nightmare (suicide rates in China also skyrocketed after 1979, if memory serves, it has one of the worst suicide rates on the whole planet), the young boys turned to what we hold dear in our hearts today (as you're likely here for the same reason they are): Video games.

Everyone knows the tales of Starcraft, the Chinese took to these games and mastered them, and soon enough, it got so popular that someone thought about making competitions to see who would stand supreme. It was amazing. And profitable. So profitable that more contests started being held, eventually moving out of the country even, into newer lands, players both Chinese and foreign were coming in, mastering and perfecting their strategy skills until we reach today.

And the game isn't a game anymore, its a micro-simulator. Its not about strategies, making plans to out-strat your opponents now, no its about smashing keys the fastest so you can build a unit, take it to the enemies base, and wipe him out in 5 minutes. I don't think China was the very first to come up with this strategy, but they were the ones who popularized it. Mastered it, perfected it. Made it ""popular"".

And soon enough this cancerous plague starts moving to other games, becomes what is now known as E-""sports"". Anyone else know why so many chinese players can be found in these tournaments, whether its DOTA, LOL, CS:GO, etc? Well, you do now.

And finally, we get to this game. Playerunknown's Battlegrounds (or PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS if your cap key's broken like Greene's is). This game SCREAMS E-""sports"" (though it sure as fuck isn't ready), though that isn't the biggest reason why China has turned this once humble break from H1Z1 into a shitting nightmare of frustration. No, its the crates. Every kill gives you battle-points, battle points are spent on crates, you can sell these on the market, you get the jist. Soon Zhang Xin and his buddies found out you could profit from this sort of thing if you get enough kills, and, hillariously enough, all Chinese players are shit at first-person-shooters. Not enough calculation for their tastes.

So they made cheats. It isn't a new concept; I don't blame China for the CREATION of cheating, just the majority cheating in PUBG.
But hey! Don't take MY word for it, what do I know? I'm just a racist, sexist, mysoginistic, homophobic, transphobic, panphobic, womanphobic, xenophobic, madeupwordphobic, anti-semetic piece of shit with too much time on his hands, so let Battleye, the anti-cheat of this game, speak for you.

https://steamed.kotaku.com/99-percent-of-battlegrounds-cheats-are-from-china-play-1821513424

You can probably tell this is a massive  shit  post so let me just be level-headed with you; I, and by extension, everyone else who wants China off of NA and EU servers, are NOT asking for China to be culled in the streets, gutted and their intestines ripped from their lower halves, we're simply asking for a region lock so that China can fuck off back to its hole, and stop spreading its hacks to the ACTUAL majority of players, who simply want to enjoy the game. Greene wants that green dolla dolla, thats fine! Region locking China would mean that more Chinese see those ads or whatever, which means Greene gets his Nip-Bucks easy peasy! And thats it. No need for a culling, no final solution for China; they've pretty much already done it to themselves anyway.

Until it happens, I'm not recommending this game to anyone; namely because there's way too many cheaters.

TL:DR: Autistic  shit  post about the greatest shoemakers in the world.

EDIT: Oh yeah, and Greene's upset his little """"""dream"""""" is getting toppled by a battle royale for 9 year olds so he's suing them for being """"""unoriginal"""""".

Servers are not stable, you get shot after going around walls, try to land near a house and get flung somewhere else and take fall damage, and other times you just get stuck trying to cut your parachute. Worst of all though is the cheaters. People coming in and shooting with no recoil, shooting from the other side of the map and killing you, and people springting around at crazy speeds. I'm honestly surprised that they added kill cams to this game because it shows you how much these bugs and hackers effect the gameplay. Also this a is personal preference but the new map pales in comparison to the first. It's like they heard that people wanted a more compact city landscape and took it to the extreme because the cities are so dense, even with random buildings you can't enter or 5 story buildings that you can only go one floor up in. Other than that there are large open areas between the cities with hardly any objects to fight amongst. I understand it is supposed to be a desert but maybe that wasn't the best choice for a shooter map design. They just took the first maps criticisms to the extreme. Oh and don't bring up the fact that the overwhelming majority of these hackers are Chinese are you'll be called racist, for simply stating a fact backed up with plenty of evidence. Just look at the other negative reviews about hackers. Bluehole really needs to include region or ping locking so you can only play on the servers that you have the best ping on. It is very annoying getting into a game where people yell in Mandarin in the lobby on the NA server and once you get into the game you just watch the kill feed as a few guys get a stream of kills. Really it is best for someone from NA to play on another server because it seems like these Chinese hackers are targeting NA specifically for some reason. Anyways as you can see I have many hours on the game but since it has gone into full release and getting called a racist for a simple thing like region locking, like many other games do, I'm tired of the game. It's a great concept but a better company needs to come along and make a more functional version of it.

Above all that is the abhorrent issue with hackers, coming mostly from China. With 'PlayerUnknown' Brendan Greene being arrogant and naive enough to blame the PUBG community (the entire reason for his success) as 'xenophobic' for wanting to region lock the game from Chinese hackers demonstrates the danger in where this game heads.

It is not acceptable that he as a developer is so naive as to not realise the neccesity of region locking the game, accepting its faults and fixing bugs to protect player interests and the integrity of the rules from hackers. Instead he labels everyone as a xenophobe for wanting to play the game without cheaters and a worsened connection and game experience as a result. This game has the real risk of turning into DayZ, where the develoment have lost interest in the community and holds a greater interest in lining the pockets of the Chinese market and abysmal console ports.

> De-sync is still a major issue. Being shot while (presumably) behind cover is frustrating.
> Loot is scarce on the new map - all concentrated in cities where building layouts are poor - corridors are tight with many doors leading to empty rooms. Compound looting that was viable in Erangel is no longer viable in Miramar, and players are forced to drop into main cities and contest each other for loot. This limits viable drop points and creates monotonous gameplay. 
> Peripheral blur on 4x/8x is a complete handicap and unncessary.

[b][u]The negatives... Theres so many:[/u][/b]

* Unwinnable battles against chinese hackers in every server

* game prob has the worst netcode I have ever seen

* They took it out of early access, yet its still a buggy, hacker infested pool of filth

* I wish I dident buy it.

* Chinese players get no server (?)

* Lag Switching in 2017? Come on, for real?

* Games pretty much alive just cuz of twitch streaming

* PLAYERUNKNOWN is such a man baby.

* Camera system is ass in CQB

* No real meaningful updates


[b][u]The Positives:[/u][/b]

* Somtimes GPU drivers boost fps... sometimes

* Makes your hands shake as if you did crack-cocaine

* Intense PvP, provided no hackers show up

* Provides roughly 2 hours of fun

GOOD:
•	Unique gameplay
•	Fun with friends
•	Fast Matchmaking
BAD:
•	Sub-Par Optimization
•	Terrible Net-code
•	Bad graphics
•	Hackers
•	Only 2 Maps
•	$30 for a still incomplete game

From beginning I personally saw in this game a big potential.
It was fun to play,  *NEW* battle royal genre, the optimalization wasn´t awesome but it was in early acess and I liked it.
NOW
- even after Sanhok update the game is not optimalized
- why is there a BATTLEPASS for fuc**** 10 €, when the game itself is worth of 30 € ? 
  * also some quests are pain in the ass to complete  and it is limited for 30 days ...
  * EU players are paying for battlepass  10 €  in USA it is 10 $ = 8.58 €  
- there was promised just one key that is going to allow open any crate, now  we have 3 of them and I won´t be surrprised if they gonna add more of them.
- the reward system based on BP points and buying crates is a one huge waste of your hard earned BP =>I would reccomed better reward system 
+ after last update servers are running more smoothly
+ deacreased number of hackers, from my point of view based on last 50 games ( EU-severs player) BUT that is just my opinion !
+ Sanhok map itself is very nice

I lost my hopes in this game, after huge hype train and effort of community that raised this game, Bluehole is just milking the game and pissin* off whole community, they are trying listen the playerbase but it seems they have sticked their fingers in ears.

If you wonder why we all have so many hours on this game with negative reviews, the reason lies with the developers. When this game first game out, it was amazing, a battle royale game so much more advanced than others previous, with a developing team that could potentially make it great. Every gamer flocked to it not only to experience a large, much more advanced, and enjoyable battle royale experience, but also with dreams of all the additions that would be added in the future. 

There was so much potential for this game, so much hype for what was to come once it was out of beta, but it never came. The game had its bugs and problems, but we all thought they would be addressed over time. It never was.

They fully released the game without truly attempting to try and fix all the issues that the game had. They market it all over, bring streamer skins into the mix, and treat it like its some kind of gem. But it isn't. It is a game that is unfinished, unpolished, and overtime, gets too frustrating to continue supporting. The developers are so proud of how popular the game got that they don't even care how broken it is. They can absolutely draw you in, but there's a reason they can't get you to stay, there's a reason their daily playerbase has dropped from 3.5 million players on at once to 1.3 million over just a few months. They can blame and sue Fortnite for ""copying"" them or whatever they want, but that's not the problem. They shifted their focus and care from the game to simply just focusing on cosmetics and making it look appealing. 

I don't even play Fortnite, but I can see how smoothly and well polished the game is, and how it runs. And it's staying popular for that reason.

Pros:
+When the game works, it's a good bit of fun

Cons:
-Horrible Servers
-Hit Detection is the worst I've ever had to handle
-Microtransactions
-Skins are laughably bad, especially when you consider that they cost real world cash
-Higher Ping gives you an advantage (WHAT?)
-The desert map is just total shit. The other 2 maps are passable
-Main Menu is made in HTML and sometimes doesn't even work
-Horribly toxic community
-Bugs. Bugs everywhere.

I could go on, but I think you get the point. Bluehole clearly is more concerned with making more and more cash instead of fixing the horrible amount of issues present with the current build. This game isn't worth your time, especially when it costs $30. 

If you need a fun Multiplayer shooter to play with Friends, Check out IronSight, or if you want your battle-royale fix, The Culling is cheaper and more intense, and Fortnite(Which is also garbage, but for different reasons) is free.

Solo FPP: 9.93%
Duo FPP: 5.72%
Squad FPP: 2.80%

I am not the best, but I am decent. I can say for certain that I have seen everything that this game has to offer. Because of this, while I love the game, it is simply not ready for anything outside of a Beta classification. Let me explain.

I, along with four other solo individuals, drop at a city in Miramar (the desert map). I grab a Level Two helmet, and a Level Two vest, along with a Micro Uzi, Stock, and 60 rounds of 9mm. The player who landed next to me has a Level One helmet on, no vest, and a P92 9mm pistol.

I wait for him/her to leave his/her building - he/she has not yet seen, nor heard me. As soon as he/she leaves, I unload the entire magazine into their chest. Remember, this player had zero armor aside from the weakest of all helmets. They turned around in the middle of my spray and took three shots almost automatic-like. All three hit me directly in the face, effectively bypassing any armor that I had.

After going back and looking at the Death Cam, I can say that even though my bullets were connecting, none of them caused any damange at all. I wish this was the only example, but sadly this is but a droplet in a bucket.

From buggy mechanics, to laggy gunfights. It is sad when you were shooting at someone, duck behind cover, and then once you're safe behind cover, to get completely riddled with bullets that were shot on the opponent's clientside five seconds ago.

After selling 30 MILLION copies of this game, I would EXPECT that the developers implement ways to mitigate laggy connections from playing with individuals without laggy connections. It could be as simple as having connection qualifications on the servers. For example:

Very Fast Servers: < 20ms avg latency
Fast Servers: < 40ms avg latency
Medum Servers: < 100ms avg latency
Slow Servers: > 100ms avg latency

The individual in the squad with the highest latency would determine which server type they joined.

To top the lack of consistent functionality off, cheaters are STILL and issue. Ever shot someone with a silenced AWM three times (back-to-back, mind you) only for them to one-tap you through your Level 3 helmet with a revolver? Or, my personal favorite, headshotting someone who is stationary 13 times with an AKM and not killing him.

Oh, and let's not forget. PUBG Corp promised that we would see a consistent amount of bug fixes. Instead of that, we got paid loot boxes. Oh joy! Just what I wanted.

With all of this in mind, I cannot recommend AGAINST this game more. Devs, fix your trash first, before you try bank rolling your customers. But of course, you've already made over $100 million off of this game, what do you care?

-- EDIT 02/22/2018 --

Well, yes and no, the highest amount of kills i've got in a single game was only 5 which is pretty pathetic compared to some pro-player like Shroud who get 20 kills atleast in a single game. But one of the biggest problems I have with the game is the amount of content is has. It has no ranked matchmaking for no particular, it has only 2 gamemodes, and only 2 maps. Also there is no reward system at all, apparently when you win a game you get credits which are called 'BP' which you can spend on crates or to customize your character again. Which became kinda useless because you can literally buy crates of the market for almost nothing.

The worst part of the game is in my opinion the peformance, the game still has piss poor framerate for a game this simple, the netcoding is ridiculous mostly at the beginning of the game because god have I seen so much people having trouble to pick up their weapons because the terrible netcoding won't let them do it. And the last thing I want to mention is how little to no customization there is, you can't change your crosshair, your reticle color, TP FOV, ETC.

Coming to the conclussion, PUBG is a sometimes fun but absolute bad game and is still in ""Early Access"", it just doesn't have the tag on it. If you're intressed in buying the game I simply wouldn't recommend it atleast for now. I'm just interested in the future of the game because it could turn out it two ways: 1. Brendan Greene actually gets of his lazy ass and fixes this monstrosity of a game to a somewhat decent game, 2. It ends like H1Z1 and DayZ and it will be forgotten and hated in a few months.

And now for the final verdict:

I get headshotted by a pistol from a player that seems very suspicious 

I get wrongfully banned when I’m just using an application that changes the scales of color on my monitor

Im still waiting for them to optimize the game so I can play at decent a frame rate but instead they add a worse version of the battle pass and MOAR loot boxes 

I get 3 punch kills but it counts 2 for my challenge

I clearly headshotted a man at point blank range yet the game insists I hit him in the hand

But in all seriousness plz just optimize the game, I know your team is hard at work and perhaps fixing your game might be impossible due to the poor foundation and rushed development when you put it out there. Might I suggest just remaking it from the ground up with better networking, tick rates, and framework?

Look at siege’s operation health, we took a 6 month content drought while they reworked the structure and core of the games networking to have a fun and playable experience without terrible lag and networking issues. I don’t care if you don’t give us content for a long period of time in order to either fix the game, or remake it from scratch.  Just please do something. Also I do think that the battle pass is a great idea for getting cosmetics while monetizing the game without lootboxes. Just make sure that the challenges are working properly and that there isn’t a ridiculous grind and xp cap for players. Also give us more time to level up.

The developers do not care about the performance of their game. All they care about is how much money they can milk from it.

The addition of paid crates was the first worrying thing. I've spent £26 on this game, yet I'm expected to pay more just to be able to customise the clothes my characters wear? Why isn't this free? Yes there are some free crates but the chances of getting them are so small, its pointless even trying. Currently as it stands, I have around 20 unopenable crates, and the game wants me to pay £2 for a single key to open one crate. Thats £40 to open them all! Thats more than I spent on the game?? And you're not even guarated good loot? Yeah, no thanks.

The Sanhok update was probably the best update this game has had in a long time. It added a new map, that showed off how good PUBG can be, but this update quickly faded out. The performance of the servers, and the optimisation of the game is appauling. I have a GTX 1080Ti, I should not be having performance problems. I should never be seeing that FPS counter go below 60. Yet, I do see it. You've probably heard all about the DeSync, so I won't reiterate this point. 

The developers also decided it'd be a good idea to implement a carbon copy of Fortnite's Battlepass. Its a blatant copy, yet they managed to do it terribly. The rewards that F2P users recieve are appauling, with it only being some cosmetic items that you can use for 30 days. To buy the battlepass, you have to pay more than Fortnite's costs, and you get less stuff. Also a no from me. 

They also like to constantly send out updates to shove the notion down your throats that they have a Invitational. Glad to know that they'll happily shove out updates promoting how you can buy tickets to see some pros play, yet rarely push out updates to fix their game. Funny that.

After 1200+ hours of the game... And yet another super amazingly good player killing me from over 400m, with no bullet travel time?! I didn't think Jedi's would ever play this game, but they do. Too bad they haven't pulled their light sabers out just yet, but I'm thinking with the way things are going, they'll be able to deflect your bullets and kill you come April or May.

The game itself is amazing in it's purest form. Anyone could win the game, no matter what level, what equipment you have and what nationality you are. My brothers won a game having fired NOT a SINGLE round in a duo game (pretty sure some sort of a record, not the most impressive one, but hey, that chicken was cooked fine). 

That's why we all have come to love this game. Then came the Jedi's. Super quick, super strong, some don't even have to look at you to kill you. And frankly, it is the single most entity killing the game. At one point, I had game after game where I was shot down from nowhere, as well as dozens of other players, by the same guy wielding a light saber of type ""AKM"". Headshot after headshot. Master Yoda.

To be honest, I have had enough. As much as I love the game, I hate it even more. The fact the developer's are saying, they will use all their developers into solving the current crisis is assuring. But then they say, we are working on new maps and cool new crates and crate items. Frankly they can shove those new crate items - you know where. They have failed to keep their promise not to release micro transactions before the full game was launched, so what stops them from doing so now? 

What do people like me and you have that gives us confidence in the developers? Absolutely nothing.

We know who the main culprits are. We know what actions need to be taken, but yet they choose not to act upon it? Server locking a region does not mean anyone is racist or has anything against anyone. But when statistics show you that an apple is an apple - what is there to think about? This is where money kicks into the argument. 

If I am a developer and I'm recieving money from people continuously rebuying the game after getting banned, why fix it? Why would anyone in their right mind fix something that would mean they will get less money tomorrow? This is why a certain jedi weilding nation will not get region locked. Plain and simple. As a result, the community is becoming ever so toxic. Questioning every death. Every head shot. And why shouldn't we?

If we want to see a change, we need to be the change. Stop pumping resources into the market. Stop helping this game break world records. WE have the power! Play a different game and do not return unless the developers have actually stuck up for the little guys. Not just the streamers. Not just their wallets. I know me and a lot of friends have already starting playing different games. And you know what, it's a lot of fun knowing the people you're playing against are stormtroopers just like you. They like having fun after a hard days work, they like a bit of challenge and they need a whole 30 rounds to kill that guy with no loot. Hence I emphasize my point; **** the jedi's, I'm a stormtrooper and forever will be!

Is the game fun?
Yes, in a lot of ways it can be very fun especially with mates and a good team.
Why not recommend it?
While the game is fun and can feel very rewarding when you finally get a chicken dinner Bluehole just does not deserve anymore money and the game does not offer anything that justifies its $30USD price tag. Even at a deep, deep sale I wouldn't recommend this game out of sheer principle.

From a functionality standpoint the game is broken. I'd say the biggest changes to the core game since it became available in early access is that sometimes the frame rate is higher and we now have vaulting over walls and other objects. We still have persistent crashes, graphical glitches galore, fps stutter and invisible walls on the edges of objects despite clear line of sight to a target just to name a few things. Not to mention the large amount of hackers. I've played a lot of online shooters but I've never run into hackers moreso than when I played this game.
Performance wise there is no telling when the game will be broken for you. 1 of my mates couldn't get the game to stay open for more than 10 minutes until a week later when it suddenly worked. For me I went from the general piss poor performance to only booting into a lobby once every few matches. This lasted 2 weeks before being fixed.
The devs are doing barely anything to actually make the game fully playable despite wanting the game to be a big part of E-sports. Whenever people ask about proper fixes being implemented to fix the games performance issues they are ignored and Bluehole will instead bring the servers down for a few hours to ""perform maintenance"" only for many people to receive the same issues they supposedly set out to fix. This is a constant occurence.

From a money standpoint Bluehole has gone from gambling crates that can only be earned with in-game currency to gambling crates that need keys to be bought to be open and a battle pass that costs $10USD. The same price as Fortnite's but PUBG's only goes for a few weeks as oppose to Fortnite's roughly a few months. They are charging the same price for less content on top of their overpriced game. The game is not even close to being in a finished state and yet the greedy devs are doing their best to open up as many avenues to take money from gamers as possible. Their main focus is to make as much money as possible while putting in the least amount of effort to development. A finished and respected product is not what the devs are aiming for. They do not have any integrity as an artist.

I made the mistake of buying this game early when graphical glitches and the occasional server issue was the only problem to worry about. After about a year of updates the devs have, essentially, only managed to introduce 2 maps, a few weapons, vaulting and a plethora of bugs. If I could refund this game I would. If you care about artistic integrity in videogames and don't want to support minimal development efforts and gambling in games then do not buy this product.

Only buy this game if you want Bluehole to earn more money for doing nothing and you are ok with these practices in our games.

TL;DR
Game is broken and devs only care about money and not a finished, working product.",1531172199,1531172199,False,4,0,0.5625,0,True,False,False

First one is whatever I write in here, forums or discussions wouldn't make a difference. Feedback is totally ignored by the developers. People are end up geting banned or silenced. While there are so many issues with the game, instead of addressing those they are working on crates and visuals. I understand and appreciate that they need to generate income, however I think they should have enough budget to sit down and fix the problems first.

It has been around 2 weeks since I've played last time, I am slowly losing my interest due to developers' approach to the issues the players having almost every single game. I'm sure I don't need to repeat, but the cheating is out of control. Let's say 50% of my cheater calls are wrong, I get killed by a skillful player that I assume cheat. Rest of the 50% is still way too much. Clearly, developers current plan against cheaters (if there's any) doesn't work. 

Rest of the issues about gameplay, bugs and improvements are also too slow and so far all patches made the issues bigger as they fix small ones. 

I'm no expert but it is obvious to me that there's something wrong with the development. I would like to see more focus on problem solving instead of mini skirts and sunglasses.

Unfortunately, I would not recomment this game in its current state and I'm afraid the current state might be better than the games future.",1519565561,1519565561,False,3,0,0.5625,1,True,False,False

Because if this game verifies every single data from the client to the server(Just like league of legends), we can barely play this game due to the heavy consumption of the resource from the server. But right now, the situation is getting worse, even on NA server, low ranks, I've encountered so many hackers, how bad is it? I have the confidence to say that 8 of 10 games. I am not whining guy who keeps saying everyone who killed me is a hacker, but as a software engineer, I can recognize who is the hacker and who's not.

As a Chinese who live in the U.S., I would like to say sorry to all the people who play this game. Most cheaters I've met are using Pinyin (it's romanization system for Standard Chinese) as their name, I've seen cheater who's flying on the ground; I've seen cheater who's shooting without zoom in and the distance between us is about 100meter away and keep shooting your head; I've seen cheater who trans himself to rubberman; I am so done with it. I like playing this game with my friends but I am getting mixed feeling about it, on the one hand, this game still entertaining, on the other hand, the cheaters keep ruining my experience.

And then I've seen people who stand out and shout ""region lock china"", I am ambivalent about this idea. I know there are almost 3million players now and I think almost 2million players are from China. People there hate cheaters too. Few month ago, Chinese people were protesting on social media to against one of the famous stream who has 1 million viewers and be suspected as a cheater. They looked for evidence; they analyzed the recorded video frame by frame from the streaming; they checked every minor account from the streamer. and they succeed. They are just like us, hate cheaters, want the justice. And I believe even in China, cheaters are the minority. But this game is so popular in China sold so many copies, even the minority could become a notable figure. But Please, trust me, most Chinese hate hackers. And they want a good game just like us. 

What we should do right now, is keep pushing BLUEHOLE to optimize their code and sever, and that is the only way to minimize cheaters. I don't care if you add some microtransactions in the game(some skins), I just want a good server and strong codes. And before of that, I won't suggest this game to anyone until they can fix these problems.",1515845653,1515845653,False,5,0,0.562429904937744141,0,True,False,False

This is what most of my friends told me, it's fun, but it's infuriating and frustrating.

I would like to adress a few issues that triggered me hard :

1. Directional sound in this game is rubbish. There's only left and right and sometimes in between. You can't differentiate between up and down, front and back. (One time I got killed from above, when I was hearing the shots right in front of me, and I couldn't figure out where the guy was, he was on a roof 15 meters away from me)

2. You will get rekt super hard, there's no way to train your aim, or to check how the bullet drops, so if you're just starting, just get used to dieing, and try to die as often as possible by taking as many with you at the start.
There are many good players that will 1 tap you in an instant while you unload the whole weapon in them.

3. The fact that you loot 20 - 30 minutes, and after a while you die without having a chance to fight back.

These are the things that annoy me. So if you're having the same triggers like me, you might want to think about this. 
The game really needs to be optimised, and I swear, they really need to fix the SOUND.

I have asked customer support(?) for the reason, asking for things like reason of ban, IP that caused the ban, and other details that could possibly help find the culprit that either hacked my account and got me banned or the steam error that caused me to get banned.
At the last game before getting banned I had another game running on another desktop of mine at the same IP address and because of unknown steam error, I was able to log in to the game without steam stopping me. 
Also a few weeks before getting banned, I kept getting messages on my phone for steam log in that I did not do. At the time I did not enable steamguard because I was annoyed logging in everytime with the steamguard code. It is possible the hacker that went around steam could have stolen and sold my login info to other users.
I have enabled steamguard ever since the ban, to protect my other games and there wasn't any more problems.
There were many more attempts to login even with the steamguard although that person could not, so I have changed my password and there were no more attempts as a result.
Sorry for the long story of mine and in the end it's a short ""DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AND EXPECT NO GLITCHES OR CHEATERS RUINING YOUR DAY.""

How Did I Find Out They Are Hackers?

1. They can tell where enemies are when I have 0 clue so they can hide weapon and run even in the very last circles without any enemies spotted.
2. They only headshot with/without scopes with any guns from any range.

TL;DR
Do not buy this game because there are SO many hackers and blue hole is a small piece of **** company who has 0 ablity of dealing with hackers.

Many of the animations feels way too slow, the game in general feels too clunky.
There's too much delay between picking up the weapon, reloading and fire it. It takes ages to aim, and everything feels too slow for an arcade game like PUBG.
No wonder Fortnite got so popular.
I hope (might be an utopia) this game gets better although I now rarely play this game since I got fed up with how the game feels clunky (because of the inutile long animations, rather than the pace of the game)...",1531786628,1531786711,False,4,0,0.561151087284088135,0,True,False,False

Only played so much because I have friends who did. Don't get me wrong, there were fun moments and I'd rather play this than fortnite but my friends were the reason I had fun, not often was it the game itself. Compound this with a development company that often prioritizes maximum profit over improving the quality of the game despite owning one of the most lucrative games in history and you've got no real reason to play unless forced to by buddies. The problems are mainly in respect to server/client performance, anti-cheat, and using a monitization method that is too close to a F2P one for most peoeple's tastes (it rubs me the wrong way, but perfromance is my main gripe). Just opt for one of the many other BR games if you're really into the genre and hope another one with an actual focus on shooting people comes out soon.

Edit: I want to clear up that I don't think the game is irrideemable, I just can't personally recommend it. If you're into the BR genre then definitly keep an eye on this game and be open to the fact that it very well might improve.

I live in NA but I'm from EU and so I play both servers. The biggest annoyance with this game is the Chinese 'players'. I'm sure there are many who are decent people. But what I'm experiencing in this game and many others, is that the majority of cheaters are Chinese and this game is rife for it. Not only that, I can guarantee that every game I log into I'll hear some recorded chinese dribble playing constantly on repeat through someones mic AND I'll have chinese just shouting down their mic's.
Please, for the love of god region lock this game.
Once I've entered a squad and been paired up with a couple of NA guys, we were complete strangers but we could communicate and play as a team. It was epic.

Its fun playing squads with friends
Seems like theyre actually doing something about the hackers
Vaulting is great

Cons-

Horrible netcode
Horrible servers
Horrible optimization
Some guns are far better than others, (Ex of bad guns SKS, S12, pump shotgun are horrible.)
Too much RNG (Expecially in the new map)
Chinese players aren't region locked yet for some reason
People that dont speak english or even try to, play on NA servers
FULL OF BUGS and glitches (im not kidding, you will literally run into them almost every game)
Horrible vehicle control
Molotovs, flashbangs are pretty much unusable in their current state.
Requires a decent computer

the developers are insanely retarded. They work against the community at any circumstances. Its like EA published this game and when you played EA games as ""Heroes of might and MAgic"" for example you absolutely know what I am talking about right now. Here are the most significant argues

- Cheater over Cheater over Cheater, 

I face Cheater every 2nd game at the moment. there is nothing more frustrating to be in a game 20 minutes with epic equipment and loot and then BAM getting killed by no recoil, aimbots all over and mostly by xianchau12231 (some chinese people)

- Bugs over Bugs over Bugs 

you arte going to start the game with bugs and probably you will finish it with bigs. Even those which are in the game since it got relesased even since alpha. The programmers oif this game got no clue about the things they are doing. After new patch releases the game keeps beeing unplayable for atleast 1 day. Dunno what they are using their testservers for. But they are obvioulsy kinda retarded.

- anti community devs 

whatever the community wishes is refused. Just for whatever reason. Examples: 
Map choose. There a 2 Maps ingame, one is awesome one sucks hard, But you are forced to play both of them, they get choosen randomly. This causes atlat 10 leavers at any map due to the reason that they want to play the other one. GJ devs
Region lock
you know there are soooo many chinese cheater out there. And not only that, you are in advantage when you play with higher ping du to the engine. So If you are playing this, play not at your region and you dominate much more. GZ Devs
and many more....



the only positive part. I earned all my money back by selling those stupid crates for 2€ each at the beginning. AND sometimes its fun to play as 4 people when there are no  cheater ingame. Whats kinda rare actually.",1520437380,1520437411,False,5,1,0.559748470783233643,2,True,False,False

The first Battle Royale ever come to such a big game is PUBG. This game is all about the last survivors of individual or in team. I can still remember the first time I lost my virginity because all the players died in blue zones, it's like you are doing nothing and you just get laid. I can still remember there are times when all my squads are dead and I was alone killing all the other squads to win the chicken dinner, it was sure like having fivesomes and you f.... so hard the other girls they just moan to beg you to stop. But nevertheless the adrenaline of this game is extreme, after winning a good chicken dinner, you can still feel the adrenaline. Your heart rates pumping rapidly, your hands were still shaking and you know you need to calm down for 5-10 mins.

The guns mechanics in this game is very good the recoil mechanism, the accuracy, the bullets drop, i might say one of the best. Over the years there were huge improvements in graphics, gameplay, bug, and CHEATS. Yeah you read it right, there were a huge improvements too with CHEATERS. 

In the old days those cheaters were so obvious. They can snap aiming you or your squad in split of seconds and hits all bullets to your body or head. Their bullets can hit through the walls. They can kill you far far away even you are not visible to them. But nowadays they are way smarter and the hacking are much more sophisticated. NO NO they won't be that dumb to kill you from miles away....people can see the deathcam....NO NO they won't direct aimbot you.... but instead using an assist aim so the first bullets might miss and the aim will come closer to you so that the second bullets will hit your body or head and the rest of the bullets will stick to your body and head till you die.

I have a solid team, which we do play almost every night. We were no pro, we are not the best aimers. But we do have good strategies and teamwork. When there were days that weren't so many cheaters. Yes we do got a lot of chicken dinners. But now with full of cheaters and hackers....not even a top 10.

To top it up thanks to all the fun with this game. It surely brings a lot of memories and we had a good laughs with so many stupid things. But with all those cheaters in this game, no I won't play this game anymore until they FIX IT. Thank you PUBG and GOOD BYE.

The first few times you play, the adrenaline rush is incredible, and you might find yourself playing for hours in the hopes of that one magical time when everything goes right and you get that Winner Winner Chicken Dinner... but after a while, you start to notice problems -- shitty textures, lag and rubberbanding like nobody's business, failure to properly load in resources (as in both loot on the ground and entire buildings themselves fail to load at all), absolutely god awful driving mechanics, the minimap does not accurately show your teammates where you put a marker (makes it very difficult to indicate to your buddies where a particularly good gun or armor is), cheaters with aimbots and ""farming"" accounts.

You keep playing, because baby that sweet sweet rush when things actually work is so incredible, but over time you start to realize that you're force-feeding yourself pounds of garbage because you think there might be a full candy bar somewhere in there.  It's addictive, and you know it's awful, but you keep trying because maybe one day it will be better...

But sadly, the developer cares more about adding new content than fixing the broken content that already exists.  The new map (Miramar) is terrible, feels like someone just went ape-shit with a terrain elevation tool randomly creating cliffs that bounce you off the side and kill you instantly from falling when you go anywhere near them.  Instead of addressing player complaints about framerates, lag, textures, widespread cheating, disconnects and crashes, the dev has decided to implement loot boxes that require keys - you guessed it - that can only be purchased with real money.  The game is being sold specifically to the ""esports"" market, and it's not even functional (spectation mode is fucking abyssmal, good luck trying to watch the action through the seizure-inducing stutters).

9 out of 11, I didn't know that this game was also Get Fucked Over By Chinese Hackers Simulator.  It's so fun to get gang banged by a bunch of hackers with parachutes that move 500 million kilometers per hour and guns that fire magical bullets that trace and instantly kill anyone within their vicinity.  Wow, I like paying $30 for a ""game"" where every server is filled with Chinese hackers that use hacks in the most dishonorable and shameless way I've seen...AND THIS WAS BOUGHT DURING THE STEAM WINTER SALE.

Also, I'm not even being racist when I say ""Chinese hackers"", because I found out that there's some shitty Internet bars in China that allow you to use some basic hacks for this game.

""As a Chinese, I apologise for those Chinese cheaters. I feel shameful when they yell ""f**k you"" in the game all the time. 
The reasons why there are so many cheaters in China, I think, is that a lot of Chinese players of this game are workers who are not well-educated, they have no sense of courtesy, they don't have a rational view of victory or defeat. And also, most of the cheaters play this game in internet bars, I heard that these internet bars usually provide some basic cheat tools in the computers.
Anyway, I totally understand the appeal of ""region lock China"", I also think it is an option to save this game. Bluehole can unlock region China when they come up with a good way to eliminate cheaters. On the other hand, Bluehole should devote all their energy to solve this problem at present.
In the end, please don't be racist""

So, yeah.

Don't get me wrong, hacking is a universal problem, but there is an unnaturally high rate of Chinese hackers and cheaters among the Chinese playerbase- and this really needs to be solved, because more and more ignorant people are viewing the Chinese with a negative perception because of this, despite the fact that most of the Chinese players are probably legitimate players.

Also, a lot of the Chinese players that many North American players accuse sound like they are just ordinary Chinese players with terrible desyncing problems.  So, this is not exclusively an issue with high rates of hacking among Chinese players.  Also, if there are better alternatives to region-locking Asian servers, I would probably be okay with it because I'm sure that there are many Chinese players that legitimately play the game and really do not want to have these hackers concentrated within their own servers.  So long as you actually provide a solution without calling everyone ""racist"", I'd be for it.

Whenever you join a server that is not flooded with hackers though, the game really is enjoyable.

It's kind of hard to explain, but, this game is a hit or miss. While the game can be REALLY fun at times; more often than not- you're going to get unlucky. By that I mean you can just immediately get shot or killed without even finding a weapon to protect yourself in the first minute of the game.

When you aren't so unfortunate, the game is pretty great. Maps are massive, game is extremely tense at all times so you will never get bored, variety of weapons, and playing with friends can make this game amazing. HOWEVER, apart from feeling ripped off numerous times, I also can't give this game a thumbs up for other reasons. Sometimes the FPS drops for no reason and will make the game a bit annoying from time to time, then there's the fact this game has a bad server so i'll be dropped from a game without warning. It happens a bit more to my friends who play this with me, but i've experienced being dropped from games despite my internet being solid along with the fact no other online game I own does this (maybe except Monster Hunter World but yea)

My main issue with this game, is the luck factor. If you end up dying early or you're just unlucky, very likely you're going to struggle or be watching your friends (or allies) playing for the majority of the running time. So that's 20, 30+ or more minutes of doing nothing. I've had great games, won a select few, but ... yea, pretty tired of dying early because I got unlucky with no good drops while the people who've landed nearby pick up machine guns with a scope. Did I mention some people seem to shoot you in a split second and you're unable to react? Not saying that they're cheating, but I find it odd how accurate their aim is every time they peek around the corner from a yard away, despite other people need to adjust their aim. Fishy stuff indeed.

Anyway, this game is great only when you're able to play the game, without being dropped, having FPS drops, or getting crap luck. Otherwise, not worth it. Game's current patches have also made the game more unfun in my opinion, with the balance being out of whack. Most of my friends have lost interest in PubG as of lately, as so have I.",1542827137,1542827137,False,4,1,0.558273434638977051,0,True,False,False

This started as a decent Battle Royale but has since turned into straight utter trash.

Since this lawsuit began PUBG has withdrawn their file, but their game has strangely gone down the gutter since then. They blatantly steal ideas from Fortnite and other games, including making a Battle Pass (which requires you to grind 8 hours a day for 30 hours straight to get the top-tier rewards WITHOUT spending money), and smaller Fortnite-sized maps. Hacking isn't as big of a problem, but it is still a big one. It's gone from every other game to 1 in 5 games that i run into a hacker blatantly aimbotting.

I later though admittedly stopped playing for quite a while. After I came back to this game in early november before the release and playing a few games here and ther in the month prior; the game never felt the same to me again. I noticed that I was starting to get irritated with this game for various reasons.

In summary after having enough experience in the game to at least be considered an ""average player"", here is my summary of the game:

Pros:
- Good graphics
- Good and unique maps layouts and designs for both of the maps available after 1.0 release of the game.

Cons:
- Shitty RNG loot after a patch long ago (that happened after I stopped playing and came back), making the gunplay very unfair, I find myself walking into a room
- The Weapon damage value in this game is awful; it takes often times 4 bullets or more to kill with an assualt rifle at the VERY LEAST IN MOST CASES (excuding desync and hit detection issues) if they are at full health when engaged, and 3 bullets to kill with a sniper rifle.
- Terrible desync and in some game the lag is absolutely enraging to top all the problem the game already has off. But, thankfully most the time you won't really notice the lagg when it happens unless you are in a fight and die from your enemy snap peaking a corner and killing you after the connection stabilizes again.
- Hit detection is fucking atrocious.
- Character hitboxes in the game are not good but not entirely bad either but still could use some working on for sure
- Players that are knocked out have just as much health on the floor as they did standing up.
- Many iron sights on many guns in the game are shit because either the aperature of the sight is so tight that you feel like you're looking through paper punchouts or the in the sight the bar used to line the shot is so thick that you can't see anything. Some example of guns with bad ironsights that I can think of off the top of my head are: AK is very similiar to trying to aim with a rail but slightly better., SCAR, mini Uzi, AWM's are literally trying to aim with a rail mount with no indicator, revolvers are just about useless, M249, any pistol really except for maybe the P1911, and i'm sure there is more guns in the game that have pretty bad ones that I just don't know about because I can never find those weapons that often.
- Bullet velocity like any other game that has it seems to be exaggerated, but no so much in this game at far ranges but at relatively short ranged you can tell it is exaggerated.
-More than half the time you will die to desync or a player that you didn't even see that either killed you in a couple seconds because they are camping in close range or you die to a player that you can't see because they are at distance and have incredible accuracy.
- Zones end up in dull open fields more times than not with the winning chance having more to do with luck that anything due to positioning.
- Parachute physics are shit.

I simply cannotrecommmend anyone to buy this game until improvements are at least made in the character hitboxes, desync, and weapon damage values. The game feels like a beta game released as a full game. It needs work still",1515487520,1515487737,False,3,0,0.557791829109191895,0,True,False,False

Server lag is horrendous. Rubberbanding makes the game unplayable a lot of the time. Imagine trying to run around a corner to cover only to be ""pulled"" back and shot. 

Loot mechanics are horrendous. Land, try to pick up the gun you find unsuccessfully, try about 5 or 6 more times, hit reload, get shot.

Gun mechanics are horrendous. I imagine some of this has to do with lag (so I'll leave out the parts about point blank misses with a shotgun), but not all of it. For example, looking through a scope with a clear view of the enemy, but hitting the ground/wall in front of you instead. Another example is the bulletproof railings, fences, etc. in the game.

Until there are some major fixes with the game mechanics, servers, anti-hack, etc., I can't recommend this game.",1514595840,1514595840,False,5,0,0.557719767093658447,0,True,False,False

What's the point of looting then taking fights when you're just going to get killed by a random cheater.

For context, I have played BR games for over a year and a half now, starting with H1Z1. I am also big in FPS games, especially CSGO.

This game, like any BR game, seems intuitive at first because you are not (generally) killed the second after you land. This gives you some time to figure stuff out. But this game has way too much for game mechanics for getting up to speed. It is comparable to Rainbow Six Seige in terms of what it has, which is good for a game where you know where the enemy is before shooting. However, for this game it is not really appropriate when you gotta look behind you at most times. I feel like H1Z1 has a good balance for mechanics in this game by keeping it free of weird scoping modes and breathing shit.

Also, while this game had been working a lot on improving itself, it is still very hard to have consistent fps on a low/mid end PC. When turning down settings do not improve consistency accordingly, it kinda suck.

I cannot say too much about the game since I haven't played too much of it. But I can say this about BR - it is not really as fun when you wanna be a fragger and are not the best in shooting games. Sometimes you barely find people, and when you do, you just get in a random fight and just die. I am an above average player on CSGO and can get the killing spree satisfaction from playing casual or deathmatch. This game is not like that.

Also, sometimes you just wanna kick back and relax, and this game might be appealing for that. But when you spend a lot of time just looting and running towards the safe zone, are you really chilling?

Maybe I'm just a hater. But (at least for now) I would rather see this game in a stream and zone out during the boring parts than play this.",1514388592,1514388592,False,3,0,0.557640790939331055,0,True,False,False

1.) Absolutely trash optimization even on high-end rig. Having a monitor over 60hz is an absolute waste unless you run this on a NASA PC. Game doesn't even look impressive for the resource drain. Playing a First-Person shooter at this framerate is frustrating. No wonder everyone cheats.

2.) Everyone has aim better than Shroud, they never miss, I encounter human aim 1/50 deaths, complete joke. Nice anti-cheat, said no one ever.

3.) UI is broken, game crashes uncontrollably, cannot connect to servers due to ""Server currently too busy"", even the menu is laggy and badly coded. This entire game is laggy and badly coded. Bad developers who are only interested in short-term financial gain.

4.) Microtransactions and skins before fixing optimization, complete joke. They are cashing in before this game dies a quick death like DayZ and H1Z1. If the developers were really smart they would fix their engine first and THEN introduce Microtransactions, this went from being a promising game to another early-access money grab, nothing new to see here, move along.

5.) Did not refund this game when I had the chance because I thought the developers would get their shit together, I regret it now, what a disappointment of a game. It runs worse now than the day it was released. Surely they are losing players, and FAST?

The fact that I've put over 100 hours into this game, only to not recommend it, should tell you something. 
The battle royale scene is full of games, some fun and some not. I've tried Fortnite; wasn't for me, but I can definitelty see the appeal. Never tried H1Z1, going to try Blackout and see if I like it. But int end, each game has its own playerbase that are drawn to the unique aspects of that game.
I played the DayZ standalone at launch. I put up with the all the bugs, so I could experience what at the time was an actual ""realistic"" survival experience. That same feel brought me to PUBG. 
PUBG isn't a call of duty-esque shoot-em up, nor is it a cartoony base-builder. It's more raw, for a lack of better word. It actually makes me feel like a person whos been dropped into a fight to the death at a remote island. The waiting only intensifies the game, as it makes it harder to accept defeat. 
Along with many other players, I put up with frustrating bugs and glitches- ""It's only early access"". The thrill and andrenaline that comes with being in the final group of souls made the pain worth it. And all the weariness of grinding dissapeared upon winning that delicious chicken dinner. 
But this game never left that point of brokeness, and probably never will. The developers are much, much more concerned with squeezing every last pitiful drop of money through microtransactions then fixing the game. Frankly, its kind of pathetic the way they desperately try to grab their money and run, knowing that this game is and will eventually die due to lack of care, like a circus making a sick elephant do tricks for as many shows as possible before they put it down.
What am I trying to say, with this wall of text that almost likely noone will ever read? 
Avoid this game; what once was an experience of of lifetime is now a decaying money trap, rotten to the core with micotransactions and game-ending glitches. It was fun while it lasted, and I am honored to have joined in with all the players around the world who bought this game and particpated in something fun as hell.
RIP my Aussie brothers, may your pings be low in another game. 
Do NOT waste your money on this game, you will regret it.

But I'm not giving the game a thumbs down for that, I'm giving the game a thumbs down because for the past week, I have put over 60 hours into the game due to it being break, and in those 7 days, I have ran into 25 hackers that are blatantly hacking, no zoom insant headshot, from hundreds of meters away. Though that is a problem, being from NA, I play on the NA servers, hoping to meet more people that speak english, but no. Instead I find lobbies with 75% of the players on the NA servers being Asian. They speak no english, and they play on the NA servers for 1 reason, desync abuse. I have watched hundreds of deathcams in the past days where I can't even see myself on the enemies screen, of course, them being Asian, and they just shoot mid air and kill me. It's done. I love the game. But I do not enjoy the game. It is about time the devs crack down on the thousands of hackers. Not only that but they need to make it so if your from NA, you can play on only NA servers, and if your from Asia, you can only play Asia servers unless you are partying up with a friend from another country. I'm done. Fix the damn game.

UPDATE: So the PUBG dev's just made an update and a post about it would be wrong to ban an entire country from servers. It's not a ban, its a region lock. Sure the CHINESE HACKERS are annoying as hell, but the Chinese de-sync abusers are just as bad. I get killed every time I peak a chinese player because when I peak they see me standing after I have hid once again. They get easy kills, abusing desync, and its BS. Fix it.

Overall the game is a huge ripoff of H1z1. Where h1z1 is all about the speed and momentum. Where Pubg is all about snipping from across the map, either inside a building, or camouflage so no body can see you. Wauw so skilled, so pro, best gameplay.
So if you like to spend 40mins being stealthy on each match, and have maybe a chance to win or die in first minutes of the game.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
Okay so this on of the games main flaws.
The game was released a little over half year ago, got out of early access. So it should be find right? It's realeased.
WRONG!
This game still have so many problems regarding performance. It's a joke at this point they have earned millions upon millions, and still can't optimize this game? 
To be fair, it's better than it was in early access, but still has a ton of problems. This game requires quit of beast to run the game probally. Even i still have problems running it, and this is my specs. 

[b]Specs[/b]
Specs:

CPU:
AMD Ryzen™ 7 1800X (4.0GHz, 20MB cache) 8 cores

GPU:
ASUS GTX 1060

Motherboard:
Asus Z97-A

RAM:
16GB - 1333 Mhz

Just take a look at h1z1, fortnite, cuisine royal (which looks quit simmiliar to pubg, but still runs so freaking smooth, and is in early access!)
All of these games are running hella smooth, but pubg even after realease can't even figure that out after release.
What they instead did, was introducing crates, keys, skins and so on.
For me personally I don't have problem with this, but my problem is when does a company have enough money?
The answer is (un)shockingly never.

[h1]CAN WE COPYRIGHTSTRIKE FORTNITE?![/h1]
If you haven't been sleeping under a rock, you know what am I talking about.
Bluehole can't stand competition in any shape or form. Fortnite has grown tremendously under a year, and irritates them to the core. Not only is fornite free, it's greatly optimized and you don't have to spend anything in the game.
Are they the same game, not at all. They are very diffrent to each other, however bluewhole think they have copied a lot from there game....
Not only is this not making any sense, because you can't copyright strike a genre, nor elements of the game 
Eventrually if bluehole wins this case against Fortnite/epic games


[h1]On a ending note[/h1]
I will encouraged everybody to boycut this game, or never get it.
Bluehole as a company is disguesting money hungry pile soul sucking bastards that only wants people moneys, and wants to dominate the Battle royal genre, and want no .
This game has earned so much money. Through free advitisement on twitch, youtube, ect. And had millions of people buying the game, they want more.

 So is the question is do you want to morally/ethically a game develop company that only wants to get more money, be the only battle royale experience and never fixes the issues the game was born with in the very beginning?

To make matters worse, the recent update release was an absolute pi$$take, pun intended: the event pass, priced at £7.49 on top of a sky-high overwhelming price of £26.99, is merely a copy of Fortnite's ""Challenge/Reward"" system. On top of this, it is a broken mess that doesn't work half the time, it costs almost £10 for a 'Season Pass' that lasts 30 days.

It's still PUBG, PUBG is still basically the same at its core, it's core is old Arma 2 mechanics/ concepts that were only fun back in 2009 because there was nothing like it and now there is so much competition that isn't anywhere near as greedily monetized or poorly made.

Don't buy the new ""Wild Card"" pass, don't bother with the game, spend your money on something decent. 

If you're desperate for a more ""realistic"" (Which pubg isn't really but whatever.) battle royale, spend your money on Arma 3 and download the free mod and play the exact same game with more content.

Bluehole is simply lazy and greedy, stop giving them money until they actually do something to make their game not feel like it was made 10 years ago.

.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Played PUBG since release, with a few months here and there off until the Sanhok dlc came out, which I bought and played that for about a week or so and realized that other than a new map there was nothing new or interesting offered by the battle pass (And the map was free anyway).

So when the latest Wild card Battlepass came out, I saw people insisting the game was not only better but this time the battle pass wasn't such a horrendously badly designed way to get people to pay more money for awful stuff, I figured I'd give it another go.

Having purchased the WIld Card DLC and re-installed the game, I had a look and to my surprise (Not really), the battlepass isn't actually much better, the rewards are bland and/or ugly for the most part, with only a couple of them being good, which ofcourse are the ones right at the end of the rewards tree pretty much. The only improvement is some of the quests to get EXP to unlock those garbage rewards are easier and less of a chore to do.

While the rewards are better than the hilarious ""timed"" items they had in the Sankhok pass, they aren't worth it for the sole reason that PUBG is just not fun anymore. 

There are better games out there and the fact the game is as clunky and sluggish as ever even after all this time makes this the final nail in the coffin for me, which is a shame as I really did enjoy the game early on when there was no competition, but now, the game is just abysmal to play compared pretty much every other battle royale game.

The only reason PUBG is as slow and poorly optimized as it is, is because it was originally based on the Arma 2/3 battle royale mod and people forgive Arma for its sluggish gameplay because of how hugely variable and modifiable the game is, PUBG however has none of that really, certainly not anywhere close to its predecessor and it's just embarrassing the game is still like this after all the time and money they've had.

Keep my £7.99 Bluehole, hopefully this experience will atleast save other people their money and eventually make you lazy, greedy Devs actually do something to bring your game on par atleast with your competition.",1553813120,1553813198,False,5,0,0.554999053478240967,0,True,False,False

It's fun, its challenging as all hell, and there is no better rush I've gotten in a video game than that classic chicken dinner screen. However, at this point in time, it's complete cancer. The amount of hackers in a single videogame is psychotic, and the fact that PlayerUnknown refuses to fix it makes it worse. You can be running around having a good time looting, when from 1.5km away, some dude jumping up and down on a hill, spinning in circles, can hit you with 3 consecutive headshots from a sniper instantly killing you, and theres nothing you can do about it. Deathcams were a great addition, but they've only helped me see just how much cheating is going on in the game. People buying hackmods and switching servers just to completely trash the NA server and make it impossible to win is horrendous, In it's current state, the game is a battle to see who has the highest quality hackmod. There is no getting around it. And when PlayerUnknown himself is refusing to add a server/region lock to his game claiming that everyone who plays is it racist and ""xenophobic"" there is seemingly no hope, because the founder doesn't want to change it. I've had multiple friends uninstall because of just how BS the game has become. It was once amazing, and I beg that it returns to its former glory, but right now, it's not worth wasting money on.

P.S.

PUBG corps, PlayerUnknown, we aren't xenophobic, I just want a game that I can enjoy again. Me getting upset at fully automatic no recoil SKS's from the top of a hill is not xenophobia. It's bullshit. I emplore you to play your own game and see just how bad it's become for yourself.

UPDATE:

Recently, I've been thinking of my old PUBG review (the one above) and thinking to myself ""This isn't a fair review anymore. The game has come a long way and earned an updated review."" Logged on today to my first game in a long time to see basically no players. After joining a 2-man squad game, I was introduced to a pleasant start of 3 kills and decent enough loot, following up to the end of the game. A squad of players in flying Dacia's and UAZ's teleporting through the sky to repeatedly attempt to run me over (failing a good few times I might add, bad on their part) and a man holding a rifle getting multiple kills with a frag grenade on enemies he couldn't even see. I'm unsure what happened in the roughly 2 month hiatus I've had on PUBG, but wow. Dissapointing to say the least",1516044653,1563809502,False,7,0,0.554319202899932861,0,True,False,False

Crates can be opened freely, with less amount of cheaters, server performance was acceptable and somehow actually steady.

Cheaters everywhere, without any supervision and management by the Company and the system.

Box loots requires keys to open them, which originally deleted the free cases for the gamers to open, trying to be another game like CSGO and Team Fortress 2 and etc.

The Main Lobby UI has improved compared to the one during beta and alpha, but somehow it made the overall gaming performance more laggy and the invitaion system sometimes occured bugs, annoying players to invite their friends.

The Server quality also dropped drastically, lagging occured in every game, sometimes can't even play a normal game with friends as everyone were lagging when looting and walking. Lag leads to multiple casualties and caused the game to be less fun.

Sure, had a lot of fun along the way but that was before they patched out all the things which were fun about the game.

There are more maps now than when I started playing, and even with more maps they managed to destroy the playerbase.

Let's start with the gameplay: 30+ minutes per round is a large time investment for a shooter only to have a win rate in the single digit percentage rate. At one point I hit nearly 20% win rate, but that was before the hackers overran the game.

Battleye anti-cheat is a joke. They do not catch, and when they do they do not deter further hacking.

Just go to youtube and search for ""PUBG charity tournament won by hacker"" - The cheating in this game is so bold that a dude who was clearly hacking won a charity tournament livestreamed to everyone.

Bluehole is also a joke. The are incidental winners where hackers are concerned. See, if you hack in this game the worst that happens is a bluehole account ban. There are cheats out there which generate accounts for you, or you can buy a new copy of the game repeatedly. Because the game is cheaper in China to buy (where most of the hackers appear to come from) it's no sweat to just keep buying it over and over.

Region locking is racist: That's the official stance of the developers of this game. So even if battleye puts out a real stat of over 95% of the hacking account bans come from China, there's nothing you can do to get away from Chinese players and have a hope or chance at winning a round.

So battleye is a joke, and region locking is racist. At least you get to play on the map you enjoy most right? WRONG! They implemented map select for a time, and Oceania (the smallest playerbase in existence for this game) started having trouble getting matches started. Rather than coming out with a preferred map function where you can at least have some control over your destiny, they took away map select entirely. So now if you don't like the map you just quit and rejoin games endlessly until you can get into a match with the map you prefer. Word of warning, this may take literally dozens of tries, and that was when there was only two maps, now there are three.

The patches. OMFG the patches. All the vehicles worked perfectly, then they messed with them repeatedly. It's like George Lucas re-editing star wars many times in many ways long after it was a beloved and successful property. These guys went to GL's school of thought, and graduated with honors. Motorcycle working good? Let's make it so if you go to fast on a straight level road you'll randomly be ejected down through the ground and die. Or if you run a vehicle into a fence the vehicle explodes. Or if you ram a car with a motorcycle it will launch hundreds of feet in the air. Or how about how realistic it is for a jeep to hit a bump at 40Kph and just flip over.

None of these issues existed during early access. It was only after they became wildly successful that all these changes got made. It's like they got a bunch of money and then held an all hands meeting: ""GENTLEMEN! We made it! *wild applause* Now the real work begins of changing everything about this game that people enjoyed *wild cheers*.""

Seriously. Wait for BF5. Wait for COD battle royale to be a thing. Try Fortnite or Realm Royale or go for the Mavericks beta. These guys are not worth even the modest 30$ USD they are asking for for a cheat filled exercise in absolute frustration with no hope of a return to the gameplay and fun which made it great.

The game is repetitive and it's not really fun in solos imo, it's mostly RNG.
In duos it's kind of fun, cause you get more loot and a bigger chance to win.

FROM MY EXPERIENCE, you don't get to use many weapons, and you'll mostly find the same 4-5 guns. 

The game doesnt give you any hints, or tutorial or any help whatsoever, so you're stuck learning on your own, and for things like bullet drop and travel distance, that might be a bit annoying, but youtube is a thing so I don't really take that as a downside.

Communication is kind of essential for duos and up, cause afaik you can't mark any position, and you rely on azimuts.

I've had no problems with frame drops or lag, running a 1060|i5 6600 rig on high with 70 stable fps.

The combat system is still a mystery to me so I can't really judge on that since I suck mad ass at killing anyone.


Pros-

It's a 100 man battle royale with up to 4 player squads, what else is there to say
The weapons feel really satisfying to shoot, they sound nice and the damage system is balanced
A lot of people dislike the DBNO state in Duos and Squad, but I really like it as a newer player, having a second life is always nice.
Each game doesn't take too long to complete, each match is about the perfect length.
Weapons are pretty common in houses you go into, and you're not always screwed by someone with 40x better gear(altho that's probably the way you'll die everytime)


Cons-

(At the time of writing this review, I had 6.4 hours, so all you 1500 hour people, take this with a grain of salt)

I hate everything about the blue circle of death, usually the safezone is somewhere completely off, and you pretty much NEED a vehicle to not get swallowed into the void.
Shotguns
The lack of vehicles on the map
A LOOOOTT of RNG, ranging from plane trajectory, weapon and vehicle spawns, attachments, vests and all that shit.
The lack of tutorials or any ingame hints for new players.

[h1]Overall the game is a 5/10 from me[/h1], I've tried to refund it, but Steam jewed me out<3
You also have the ability to drop a couple crates if you play well, and they're somewhat expensive (ranging at around 80 cents.

Pick it up if you have a friend, cause the solo matches are pretty boring imo",1516636752,1516746719,False,3,0,0.553431808948516846,4,True,False,False

My PC Specs are listed:

Motherboard: Asus Z170
CPU: Intel i5 6600k
GPU: GTX 1080

I run this game on Ultra Low with Ultra High view distance for two reasons. The first is the fact that there isnt any grass at long distances so it makes it easier to see opposing playes. The second is the fact that I cannot run the game at a solid 60.

After playing for a long time this game sadly is being plagued with poor developer choices leading to a half baked mess launching out of early access. If you are reading this review the you know the new map is getting all kinds of love and they do deserve the applaud. This wouldnt be a problem if they could also fix the game they are developing while they add new content.  It is a game that will be great if it doesnt get abandonded after its release, which seems probable since they have stated they will be focusing on cosmetics only after release and because they are already working on a new game which is an MMO...

DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME.

**Review**

So PUBG first caught my attention when it blew up in popularity through various media platforms (Twitch, YouTube, Reddit, etc.) and looked to be a fresh take on a previously-untapped game genre (for the most part). For the first few weeks, even the bug-riddled mess that this game was found itself rapidly becoming one of the most fun games I've ever played. If you wanted to run solo and 'tryhard,' you could. If you wanted to mess around and try to get your friends killed in the most imaginative ways you could think of, you could. PUBG was an awesome look into what a Battle Royale game *should* be. For the most part, guns were balanced and gameplay *felt* great. It was a refreshing venture back into tactical gameplay with a play-as-you-like twist; any strategy was viable, if you were good at it. 

Now, PlayerUnknown (whom for simplicity's sake I'll refer to as 'PU' henceforth) himself has sentenced his cash cow to death (at least for Westerners). The game went from a hilariously fun pastime to a disappointing chore. Every time I get the itch to play PUBG, I queue up for any game mode (solo, duo, squad, TPP, FPP) and am almost always immediately reminded why I and many others cannot stand the game anymore: hackers. 

This game has *THE* most rampant and unabated cheating problem of *ANY* video game I have *EVER* played online. By his own admission, PU has gone on record stating (paraphrasing) ""99% of known cheaters in PUBG are Chinese."" Almost immediately after, an overwhelming portion of the community has started to demand Bluehole (now PUBG Corp. I believe) region lock China, to which PU has called his playerbase ""xenophobic."" The result of this assumed xenophobia is a plague that every Western player is now subjected to. I have personally experienced a game with *EVERY SINGLE ONE* of the following issues. In every one of these games, the culprit had a completely gibberish string of characters/numbers and spoke Chinese (also keep in mind this is on the North American server).

- Teleporting hacks
- Increased movespeed hacks
- Aimbot and instant-kill hacks
- No-recoil hacks (usually found with aimbots)
- Invincibility hacks
- ""Wall"" hacks (the ability to see other players through walls, buildings, etc.)
- Being randomly placed in squad games with one or more Chinese players who refuse (and, realistically, cannot) communicate with the rest of the team
- Chinese ""teamers"" ('randomly' queued players who surpass the limit of 4 per team and group up to form a horde)
- And many, many more...

There is no greater disappointment than to spend 30 minutes in a game scavenging and looting the best gear you can possibly find only to be instantly killed by a Chinese hacker. Playing the game is nothing more than a colossal waste of time nowadays. With the stance he's taken, PU has made it clear he has no intention of solving this problem as ""60% of the playerbase is in China."" Rather than upgrading any sort of anti-cheat or punishing the infinite amount of cheaters in the game, Bluehole seems more preoccupied with creating and rolling out new cosmetic crates.

I do not foresee a future in which PU acknowledges that what Bluehole is doing is nearing the definition of ""corporate greed"" with each day that passes, and it truly is a shame. PUBG was a great game - emphasis on ""was.""

Don't waste your time with this game. Save yourself the frustration and money. Go play Fortnite.

So to start off pubg is one of the most selling games on PC currently which is ok but it has MANY issues as a game. Even though it's still in beta i think anyway.. 

Shotguns - Never in a game that i have ever played have i had to talk about shotguns. But in this game they are just ridiculous in pubg. I stand 2m away from my enemy and shoot and it takes of an ATOM of their HP. But when someone shoots about 200m away with their shotgun it probably will do over 50+ damage... This has happened to me MANY times at the start of a game and usaually results in me smashing my keyboard several times.

Bikes - Basically if you go in a STRAIGHT line, you go flying half way across the map and end up dying because of this.. Bikes in this game are gambly at times. Please fix this as I have seen MANY youtubers and twitch people who have had this happen to them.

New map - I don't know who at all would want a giant ass desert map in a long - medium range combat game. All that happens in this map is I always get sniped like 1000m away by a hacker etc. And also I never get any loot and NEVER can survive to the top ten in this map. It was a complete waste of time and a flop in general.

CQC (Close Quatar Combat) - Fighting in close range in this game is a complete NIGHTMARE. I always have a 20% chance of winning in a CQC situation in PUBG. The movement is so awkward and hard to handle in a situation as this and always gets me killed.. Especially by a damn shotgun.

In conclusion i think that pubg should focus on map selection which would make the players in pubg much more happier then they are now. Also they should sort out the shotguns as they are op as FAK in this game. If they do this a lot more people will like this game more and will improve customer experience as a whole. But if they leave the game as it is then i can see this game dying very soon in the future,

PUBG claims to ban them but they just buy  new accounts and continue.
It is a so upsetting to play against those people.
Also: Even tho the game is released fully in it's 1.0 Version there are a ton of bugs.
Map errors that allow to hide inside rocks. Vehicle errors that make the vehicle fly away and kill you.

Upsides:
- tactical game
- big maps
- lots of weapons and equipment

Downside:
- Still full of hackers
- bugs and glitches such as map errors, vehicle errors etc.
- instead of fixing and FINISHING the main game they release XBOX and mobile versions that actually work better then the original game.",1522003987,1522003987,False,3,0,0.552238762378692627,0,True,False,False

Cons are:

Inconsistancy

Broken Physics

On one hand, I'm willing to wager that it's just not for me despite having a strongly competitive nature. On the other, signs are pointing toward PUBG being a definitively bad game. That said, it does have a few good things going for it:

They improved the matchmaking so that Asians wouldn't end up in the same servers as Americans (and though that sounds very politically incorrect, during the early access stage of the game I always found myself diving from a plane full of cheating Asian micspammers). Adding to that, there's not much competition. Every other battle royale tries too hard to be like Fortnite or PUBG and it's legitimately sickening even trying to play anything else.

As for all the dirt I have against the game, the hit registration (and I double-checked, I'm using the term correctly) is very inconsistent and there's been ample bug reports and complaints about hits that shouldn't register. On the note of ""real-life"" bullet mechanics, lag becomes a huge issue (especially given that it's ~100 people connected to the server at once) and if that isn't enough to ruin your appetite for 1 man against the world, it's even more heavily defined by RNG. Two things play into this factor: 1) where you drop will either contain 2 machine guns, level 3 apparel and plenty of frag grenades and first aid, or a pistol and some ammo with a single smoke bomb. I guess that is the trade-off of playing a Battle Royale, but even more over it makes it near impossible to secure a kill, experienced or not, against an armored foe who can spray you down. 2) 90% of the time, the winner is whoever sees the other player first. Predator versus pray, but even a bad player can be the predator. At this point the game looks a lot more luck and a lot less like skill. I think my final complaint is about how immature and childish the fanbase is. It's like a bunch of middle schoolers stuck in the bodies of guys in their mid 20s who probably beat their wife and send death threats over the mic as they approach the top 10. As much as I'd love to say this game has a chance of being redeemed, at this point it's hard to say it's going anywhere after nearly 2 years of active development.",1542625410,1558524952,False,3,0,0.551752209663391113,27,True,False,False

Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a primarily Battle Royale shooter game playable in both First and Third Person. The game looks and feels quite similar to ARMA in most ways, as it should be considering it's roots as an ARMA modification. But you already knew that, didn't you?

PUBG has a lot going on under the hood (so much so that running the game itself is half the battle) and for the most part, it's almost entirely done wrong. It's really a shame, too, that of the issues that stem from Battle Royale as a concept in general (which there are many of), are only compounded by PUBG's various underlying issues. But lets go down the list one step at a time.

It's based on an ARMA-esque engine, so there's not a whole lot to complain about in regards to how it looks in still-frames. The problem is actually trying to play the damn game at a reasonable framerate, again pulling from it's ARMA roots. The game CAN run, on rather mediocre hardware quite honestly, but when gunfights start and particle effects start flying, thats when problems begin to occur. I don't think I need to explain how a consistently-inconsistent framerate is bad for ANY game, let alone one where the difference between life and death is a single bullet.

[h1]Sound Design[/h1]
This has only recently been addressed so I can't speak in good faith about the sound design. However, historically speaking it has been servicable at best, and flat out misleading at it's worst. When the game has been [b]fully released and out of early access for [i]five whole months[/i][/b] and only now they address the problem that you cannot tell if you're being shot at from above or not, that should say something about their development priorities. With that in mind, gunshots and all that more or less get a pass, as they each make a destinct sound, telling you exactly which gun you are about to be domed with right before it happens.

[h1]Control[/h1]
The game controls quite well most of the time, although whenever the player is in the air, control is taken away entirely. It's realistic, sure, but it's not very ""fun"" compared to something like Counter-Strike or DOOM. That said, it's a design descision, not a design flaw, so I can hardly hold it against the game. Aiming feels extremely stiff, and yet somehow floaty when making large adjustments, making close range gunfights quite difficult to manuever in. Overall though, minus the awkward as hell jumping mechanics (and not always reliable vaulting mechanics) the game controls well enough for what it's trying to do, which is create a semi-realistic shooting game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Oh good, the bad part. Alright, in order to understand why PUBG just doesn't work as it otherwise should, first we need to discuss why Battle Royale genre in general is flawed as a competitive medium due to an overreliance on luck or randomness.
[olist]
[*]Location - Every player starts out the game in a plane flying overhead of the map. You must exit the plane by the end of the flight, or it will kick you out. While the flight path is outlined on the map, the Circles of Death are not. What this means is that, no matter where you decide to drop, or even if you leave your drop up to fate, you may or may not be in the ""Safe Zone"" once it appears. [b]While players are given a modest amount of time to enter the circle, ultimately those who - by pure chance - ended up in the Safe Zone immediately, have more time to loot, and have far more options in regards to picking looting locations.[/b] Those outside of the Safe Zone, depending on the distance from the Safe Zone, will have to forgo looting to the same extent as those inside the Safe Zone. All because of a random circle placement. This is not always fun, this is not always fair, but it is Battle Royale.
[*]Loot - Every player starts out with nothing but the clothes on their back. No weapons, (nearly) no carrying space for loot, no healing items, nothing. What this means is that players, upon hitting the ground, will need to find a weapon and/or enough ammunition for said weapon to win a gunfight. To a point, this aspect is skill based, as it's a race to see who can loot the fastest. [b]However, [i]where[/i] loot spawns, and [i]what[/i] loot spawns is entirely random, resulting in entirely-empty two story houses next to backyard sheds with assault rifles in them.[/b] Your entire game can be ended within the first 30 seconds of playing simply because you picked a bad house, and the guy next to you didn't. Furthermore, this problem doesn't end just because you survived the spawn rush. This persists all the way through the game, as you will no doubt experience within your first few hours of gameplay. A situation where you are equipped with low or mid tier weapons, matched up against players who simply got lucky, or managed to snag a crate. This is not always fun, this is not always fair, but it is Battle Royale.
[*]Crates - Throughout the game, there will spawn crates of high tier equipment which can only be found in these crates. If you didn't get lucky and loot a vehicle, or if you just plain aren't around to see it at all, then you likely won't see these weapons/equipment for quite some time unless you get the drop on someone who did. Or until you get domed by an AWM from 300 meters. This is not always fun, this is not always fair, but it is Battle Royale.
[*]One Life/Practice - Because the game gives you one life, and because loot is randomized, and because there is no alternative Deathmatch type mode to practice in, you will likely never be 100% comfortable with the weapons you find throughout your adventures. PUBGCorp has put up some temporary alt gametypes before, but they last 72 hours, and come by maybe once or twice a month. Why they don't just keep their ""War"" gametype on permanently is beyond my comprehension, as myself and so many others both appreciated it for the opportunity to practice with guns, and simply relax and have fun with the solid shooting mechanics, as opposed to being on edge for a half hour sessions of praying you don't get slaughtered at any given time.
[/olist]
I could go on, talk about Red Zones and the finer points of how vital loot is versus how luck based it is, but I think I've made my point. Keep in mind these 3 issues are persistant across ALL of the BR genre, not just PUBG. So for those of you who are reading this thinking Fortnite or the eventually CoD BO4 Blackout mode might be a suitable escape, think again. [b]Having said all this, the gunplay is solid, and when you are actually able to stand toe to toe with an enemy, the game can be quite enjoyable as I mentioned breifly when tlkaing about War mode, PUBG's version of Deathmatch. But the problem lies in that wonderful word ""if"". ""IF"" you can stand toe to toe with your fellow players. ""IF"" you found enough ammo to sustain a gunfight. ""IF"" you managed to find armor to avoid damage and healing to undo it. All of these aspects make a game that, at it's core, is uncompetitive by nature, though designed in a way that does not support it.[/b]

[h1]Microtransactions[/h1]
Fuck off and die. Fix your game that millions payed actual real dollars for, then you can think about ripping every one of them off.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
At the end of the day, PUBG has a very intertesting, but very frustrating design foundation. When the fate of your character is akin to a roll of the dice, even against other players of otherwise equal ability, it doesn't make for a very fun time. Furthermore, PUBGCorp has shown themselves time and time again to be borderline incompitent regarding community outreach and simple bug fixes, as well as game stability and optimization. I would not reccomend this game to anybody, so much so that I have removed the game from my Steam account permanently. No refund either, just a very frustrated player that's at the end of his rope regarding this game, and this genre.",1527101410,1527101465,False,5,0,0.551614463329315186,0,True,False,False

The enjoyment provided has exceeded vastly the money spent on it, the crates that I have sold has given me back the full price of the game since I have bought it.
But the only caveat is that all the fun I've gotten from this game is not from the game itself, it is from my friends whom I play with that have provided me with the solid hours of enjoyment.
Without them this game wuld be what it actually is: a bad game.
The game itself is flawed in several aspects:

- The performance is embarrasing, poorly optimized and updates does nothing in this regard.

-Lack of progress: being live and 1.0 since december and early access long before that the game has as of recently offered a small hint of progress and achivement wiuth the Sanhok missions and XP that came with the pass that they are selling, other than that or previusly the only progress you culd feel was to win or not.

-The game is mostly about luck: sure, there is a learning curve and it is not hard to master or at least get on a decent stand against the rest but due to the awfull networking and lag issues it doesnt mater if you are a great player or have great teammates, one person on the other side culd have the edge on a fight just because the server synced with his shot right before it has synced wityh mine and there you have it, dead even if you landed a kill shot on your enemy before he landed his on your end.

-Networking is bullsh¡t: No matter how many updates they put out the netcode is embarasing for the most played game out there.

-Hacking: Despite having daily security updates, the hacking community is alive and well roaming every server, specially the ones that get less attention form the devs.

-Devs don't care at all: Having the best selling game of 2017 and the most played game of the past 12 months only encourage them to monetize the last bit of content in the game rather than take care of covering the barely minimum requirements of a game this size in terms of social impact, because the game itself is albeit small in comparison with other massivly played ones. Servers like SA up until this day don't have all the game modes available even after months of them being available on bigger servers, wasting money and time in updates that don't benfit the game despite what the dev notes say neglecting a massive market as is Brazil and the rest of SA.

-Monetize everything: It is exhausting to be bombarded with boxes, packs and pasess available to buy and not seing all that money being put to something usefull or enjoyable by itself. The game even in the early months of early acces had skins abtainable from lootboxes that one culd not even see in FFP, forcing us to see stock weapns skins for months and then after that release those skins.

-Milk the early access cow until it is dry: The game is arguably at the level of what one culd expect of an early access game, suffering from all of the avobe despite being a ""full game"" already. Seems like they change the interface and rebrabded themselves as a full game and out of early acces without giving actual full and running game status or feel. 

In summary, this game is only enjoyable because I play with close friends, not because it is a good game.

  * Why are matches not ping based if one can simply meta with high ping?
  * I literally had a game where the de-sync between server/clients was so bad, my teammate did not render an enemy I saw out in the open next to a rock. Not to mention 5 kar98 shots mysteriously went through him.

I've been thru over 35 hours in this game - won only once (in duos). 

All the good times spent playing this game were mostly the moments when these firefights and shootouts really felt realistic and tactile.
The feeling that this game is based on Arma3 is certainly hidden somewhere there, but lacks the polish that Arma has.

Most of the time you are going to be shot thru corners, stones, trees, or you gonna just get fistpunched down by a guy who landed next to you.
It's a laggy shitfest, with huge latency jitters and rubberbanding and bugs. 

Really you do need to prepare that most of the time spent in this game will be just pure disappointment - but hey - it's so addictive and real!
Yes exactly, this game resembles our own lives - full of misery and shortcomings, we live our lives feeling people and world are laggy and jittery, we just wait for better times to come.

If your pants are on fire, and you are stupid, like other 2,3 million players every evening (I mean in one moment) then yes buy it and be like everyone else - complaining how life is hard in such a great game.

The first 10 hours were really enjoyable and I was thoroughly enjoying the battle royale concept as I had not played a game like this before. Getting kills was exciting, or landing in a tight spot and coming out victorious. Communicating with your teammates to spot and take down enemies was really fun

This excitement quickly faded as within the first 10 hours , more and more annoyances came up. Buildings not loading in, incredible loading times and gunplay that feels about as responsive as throwing sponges at your enemies.  The entire concept and what they did with it lost it's charm when games forced you to hide for 20 minutes to get shot and wait 20 more minutes to get to that point. All poor design/optimizations problems aside, this is my biggest flaw with the game. 5 minutes of every 30 minute game is fun. The beginning and the end are usually quite tense (If you're not perpetually falling on an unloaded building) but it's not  nearly enough to justify playing it.

I tried the game again as it was fully released and every single point I made still stands, however the new map seems like an improvement. Personally I much prefer Apex as it has none of these issues and runs a lot better. Quick games with barely any loading or filler.

First of all the movement and just simple slowness of the game is literally mind boggling. It feels like im playing console on my pc. Secondly the sheer amount of buildings and hidey places in this game is disqusting.. ive made it to the top ten 3-5 times and have yet to even see a single player, and even if you are to be shot by someone, theres no mechanic in the game to be able to the where the shot came from, what kindve gun, infact does the game even have mechanics? ive landed in the most populated places multiple times and always seem to get killed by someone just hiding in a room, or hiding on the roof. The sound ques in the game are absolutely garbage, considering the red zone is almost always in the distance but makes just enough noise to drown out anyone moving. The parachuting in the game feels like they used a farming simulator to create. The map is literally so large that a game will take around 40 minutes to complete and thats just the top ten who knows how slow it is from there on.  Im not a person who hates games at all, playing a wide variety of games from OW, to wow, COD, h1z1, witcher, god of war all kinds of games and i have never had less fun than i have had playing PUBG! If i were to say there were good things about the game they would be extremely minor such as the gun models and variety of guns keeps each landing fresh and spontaneous, however almost every AR is worthless without a scope. The only thing i really enjoyed about PUBG was the cars. And why do you think this games so popular? Is it the large streamers that play it, is it because of the realism, or is it because you just dont enjoy other battle royale games? If it is realism i just dont see it. If i were shot in the back in real life i would know i was shot in the back and would turn around, in PUBG you could literally be shot in the face and have no idea where the bullet came from.

EDIT 1: They temp-banned me, again, for this ""reason"":   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfn9mraMNwc


The support is very poor, they are not trying to help you to fix any issues. First you will receive automatic messages. Untill your -temp ban/issue- is over
Then they reply: you're ban is lifted, whats the point? 

I tried to explain in the video, there is context in this all. It's not ""1 minute of gameplay"" before the report.
For those who watch the video: FjordKing was outside of the cave, the whole game he didn't run in to search for loot.

EDIT 2:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1644727981
Apperently they ban for ""irritating"" players! Make a decent ranking system so im not matched up with people that dont communicate and do their own thing in a squad game. Running away from knocked teammates or jump alone.
Bluehole/PUBG = shit. Confirmed.

EDIT 2: 
Within the new update regions got removed. Thanks Bluehole for being the most shit company in the world. 
New update with option to ""enable anti-cheat"". Suggest there is a decent anti-cheat. First game cheaters all over!
Next games I figure out im on freaking Asian server, only with chinese people!
In stead of locking them you let me join them, on their servers..................

I dont want to compete against chinese, jumping random and no communication, I dont want to compete against cheaters.

Make the game more competitive by new ranking, ban more cheaters, let them buy more copies of the game, earn more money, go on. Ruin the game more for active competitive players.

playing this game will dramatically reduce the lifespan of your GFX card as it kills itself trying to run this unoptomised poorly coded bundle of shit.  I run a high end gaming rig, virtually silent on most high end games, with PUBG my PC is trying to explode itself into flames.

The netcode is equally terrible with hits frequestly failing to register only for the high pinger to turn calmly in your spray of bullets and one shot you.

What is acceptable in an early access game is not acceptable in a full release.  Note to the delveopers: adding vaulting system to an unfinished game does not make it finished.
  
Greedy fuckers simply pretended the game is finished, cashed in, and went on holiday with your game dollars.

To be balanced, the game mode is genius, it gives a real sense of tension and jeporady but after time it is overshadowed, in fact utterly destroyed by the abysmal execution.

I really wanted this game to be amazing but with many early releases that get your cash up front it fails to deliver a finished product.  I really hope a decent developer can take this idea and produce it in a playable format.

My advice, avoid.

Steam community, believe everything you heard about this game from your friends. It is absolutely true. This is THE loading screen and running simulator for our generation. I bought this game in early access, and didn’t really play it until it finally went 1.0, and I can not believe what I've been missing! Every single game this week has started with the exhilarating Loading Screen, will the game start? Will it keep loading forever? How many times do I have to Ctrl+Alt+Dlt and close the program and restart it before I return to find myself either parachuting at the furthest possible corner of the map, or load just in time to see my naked body beaten to death by a player in their underwear bearing a crowbar?

I'll tell you, this. Is. A. Mystery. I haven't felt this much suspense since waiting for Michigan's electoral college votes to report in during the 2016 election. I'm with HER!

And the precious few times your character loads BEFORE it is murdered AND teabagged, that's when the real fun begins. You see, this white circle controls the entire game (Racist). Nine times out of ten, it spawns on the complete other side of the map from where the plane ejects you. Let me tell you, this map is HUGE! So then you get to crawl around, find a motorcycle helmet and an UZI (which you can put a scope on!) and then sprint for like 8-10 minutes! It's the most realistic sprinting I've ever seen, its totally like you're there, in the game, running from some giant blue wall of death, into the safety of the white circle (Racist), all the while chugging energy drinks to stay alive! 

And I know what you're thinking, ""I heard this game has vehicles too"". It DOES! There are tons of vehicles! You can usually find them charging at you full speed while you are in the middle of an empty field or desert, sometimes you can even drive them for as many as 15 seconds before they flip and run out of gas! Talk about a thrill ride. And hilarity ensues if you try to eject from the vehicle at anything other than 1mph. Don't take my word for it, see for yourself.

Finally, when I thought this game couldn't get any better, Bluehole does what the community always wanted added. Microtransactions! You used to be able to spend your in-game points towards nifty free accessories for your character, but now I GET TO BUY the ability to open the crate too! $2.50 for a key to unlock the chests that used to be free during early access, all in the extremely slim chance that I get something cool like a jacket or bandana! WHERE DO I SIGN UP? Some people in the community aren't all that happy that the apparently 80% locked crate drop rate sometimes has a 20% chance to give a free accessory, but I say, don't you let those poor sports ruin your fun.

So, without going any further, I'll leave this review with the following recommendation. If you like: black loading screens, watching your character be beaten, running for minutes at a time, camping (no smores), wacky vehicle controls, white circles and blue walls, and most importantly MICROTRANSACTIONS, then PUBG is the game that perfected the Battle Royale game style. PUBG will have the community playing constantly until the first better game comes out. 10/10 for microtransactions!

1. Gameplay.
 Looting simulator when you are looking for items for 30-40 min and then get killed by sniper with single shot. Whole game is a russian roulete so mostly luck decides who would win.
2. Lags.
How about to play for 30-40 mins, and then die because of stucking in a texture of stone riding motocylce. Here we go.
How about to by a f****cking chinese supercomputer to play this game without lags?
How about to play for 30-40 mins and then your game will crush what obviously leads to your death? And how about same thing happened every 5-6 games?
If u don't mind this u can actully try to play it. 
3. Desync.
In pubg there is a big differene in what is going on server and what is going on your screen.
Even desync in 0.3-0.6 sec makes this imposible to win fair 1vs1 fight. You think u were hiding behind the cover? Nope you were busy catching all f*****g bullets enemy shot in you.
4. Cheaters
All good sides of this game really goes away when you were killed by a chater. Game is used to relaxing, not to making me feel my helplessness.
5. Bluehole. 
With all these sides Bluehole really made one good improvement - map choise.
After community became mad at them.
But I DON""T NEED NEW F***NG MAP. I NEED TO PLAY ON OLD ONES AND PLAY WITHOUT EVERYTHING I TOLD HIGHER.

A similar style of gameplay to some gamemodes in ArmA 3, Fortnite and basically any other battle royale title. It has a simple concept: Shoot people, don't die and stay in the ring. It's catered to a very casual audience. It can be quite a laugh with friends. I think depending on your rig ArmA 3 is going to be a much better purchase because of the insane amounts of content and mod support. Devs aren't to be trusted and they're greedy and generally behave like idiots whenever they see competitors in the industry such as Epic Games. Huge lack of support when it comes down to bug fixing and optimisation. Microtransactions aren't doing the game any favours.

[h1] Pros [/h1]

- Very accessible to a casual audience. Whilst more hardcore games like ArmA 3 may not be.
- Good fun with friends.
- Gameplay is simple and easy to pick up.
- Good map diversity
- It is satisfying to win.
- It is popular among the streaming community

[h1] Cons [/h1]

- Poorly optimized.
- The ratio of bugs to content is grossly even. (More on that later)
- There's no incentive to keep playing aside from the high amounts of action.
- Lacks a decent progression system.
- Uses a 'loot crate' business model that is popular among these sort of titles.
- You can get argueably more content in ArmA 3. (More on that later)
- The amount of weapon choice is limited with a total of 30 weapons across the board including the 5 pistols that you're going to use for around 2 seconds at the start of the match.
- It is a very overated game that doesn't really deserve the amount of coverage and attention it gets.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

Firstly, the gameplay is easy to understand making the game easy to pick up. However, this can lead to apathy with a lot of players; myself included. This can get boring if you're looking for a lot of fleshed out content that is complex and in someways realistic. Secondly, (and I think this is the biggest problem) there is no progression system aside from earning coins to buy boxes that gradually increase in price. I don't mind RNG loot systems, but this isn't World of Warcraft or The Division. Cosmetics should be unlockable not only through crates but also through some form of progression system like in Halo Reach. In Halo Reach if you saw someone the 'flaming' effect on their helmet you'd think twice about challenging them head on. In PUBG you see someone with a cool cosmetic you're just like: ""Meh, they got lucky with their loot crate."" I think a decent progession system would keep the the playerbase more interested and give them something to focus on whilst playing the game.

[h1] The state and health of the game [/h1]

There are bugs that are in the game that have been around since the pre-release testing. Some minor, some major. This is to be expected with any title especially one which uses servers which house 90+ people. I don't really care about bugs with most titles I play regularly such as GMod, ArmA 3 or World of Warcraft because I prefer a game which has lots of content and a few bugs as oppose to not much content and not a lot of bugs. So if there is a lot of content maybe there's a lot of bugs. I'm not bothered with that, assuming that they're not absolutely ridiculous.
The amount of times I have died in PUBG to glitchy vehicles and poor netcode is beyond me. I have similar issues in games like Battlefield 3, 4 and 1 but if you look at the amount of content in those games a bit of poor netcode isn't really a big deal and most of the time isn't going to affect you in most cases due to the pace of the action.

[h1] My overall opinion about PUBG and it's competitors along with a conclusive rating [/h1]

I think that PUBG has got a lot of potential in it if the devs allowed for mod support. ArmA 3 has mod support and is a very fleshed out title. I think people probably haven't played half of the content in ArmA 3, perhaps they don't want to but that's a different conversation for another day. I think the gunplay or incentives to play aren't very satisfying and definitely need to be fiddle around with. The game does need a lot of optimization patches and bug fixes. Also, the weapon divesity is poor.

In my opinion I'm going give PUBG a 5.5 out of 10 because for the heafty price tag of £27 I think it vastly lacks content in comparison to it's competitors such as ArmA 3 or the free to play Fortnite: Battle Royale.

[h1] My Opinion about the Developers [/h1]
I think that the developers haven't done much to help the game and I think that they have been very greedy and dishonourable to the competition. I think that wrongly sueing the competition such as Epic Games for no valid reason is disgusting. They have steered away from fixing the prevelant bugs and optimisation issues. Instead, they have focused more on adding microtransactions that don't really enrich the game in any way. Whenever they see a threat to the company or the game such as successful competition they start lobbing sh!t everywhere.",1518529515,1532869000,False,3,0,0.550172984600067139,0,True,False,False

[list]
[*] Attractive map design, lovely buildings with comfortable furnishings and meticulous attention to detail. Coming from ArmA where buildings are completely empty, this is something worth mentioning.
[*] Decent game physics (movement, car handling, bullet drop, …).
[*] A good variety of weapons.
[*] One of the rare military games where you can also play as a woman.
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*] The outcome of the game is mostly determined by luck. In the early stage, it is by pure chance whether someone ends up with a decent weapon first. Similarly, in the last stages, luck decides whether you or your opponents must leave cover first before getting wiped out in the open field.
[*] If you go for highly populated areas, you must be lucky to find a gun first. If you go for abandoned places, you will run for 20 minutes until you finally receive a lucky headshot while you bandage yourself under the first tree within the circle. The killer is glad to receive a myriad of ammunition and a factory-fresh rifle where no bullet ever has left the barrel.
[*] Unfortunately, the game is being ruined by hackers who excessively use instant healing and aimbot. 
[*] Both available maps are bare and have scant vegetation, offering little opportunities to find cover. 
[*] The game incentivizes camping and disincentivizes engagement. 
[*] A general remark on the game mode: One or two players often end up spectating their teammates for 10-20 minutes if they get killed in an early stage. Clearly, this is somewhat frustrating compared to other game modes where a respawn is possible.

The good:
- Squad matches can be tons of fun, can't speak for solo as I haven't played it all that much.
- It can become really immersive, especially when you find yourself trying to figure out from which location the sound of an enemy's footsteps or gunshots are coming from.
- If you don't take it too seriously, it can at times remain fun regardless of the (admittedly) frequent bugs.
- Loot exists, but it is nothing more than cosmetic, which means you cannot pay-to-win if you play by the rules (more on this in a bit).

The bad:
- If you have money burning a hole in your pocket, you can buy nonsensical loot crates containing nothing more than cosmetic items. Not really a bad thing necessarily, but you can waste your money, should you be so inclined.
- Expect the game to crash on you for no good reason, with such magnificient error messages as ""bad client"" and ""kicked player"" for your reading enjoyment. Do not expect to ever gain any understanding of what those messages really mean, as no one seems to know.
- The amount and size of updates this game has is ludicrous. You'll open up Steam, see there's been a 5GB or 9GB patch, and most times you wouldn't notice any of that data going towards improving the overall experience in any tangible way whatsoever. Sure, new content might pop up from time to time in the form of new maps, guns, vehicles, cosmetic items to play dress-up with your character and so on, but none of the patches seemingly go towards fixing the fundamental problems this game has had for quite some time now.

The ugly:
- As it turns out, you CAN pay-to-win in this game. ""What do you mean, fine sir?"" you might be (but probably aren't) asking. Well, you can expect to find players (seemingly mostly from a specific location that starts with a ""C"" and rhymes with ""China"") using speedhacks, auto-aim, x-ray, teleport, and I'm not %100 sure about this one, but I swear some might even use the old IDDQD god mode at times.
- Hit-reg is utterly atrocious at times. Expect to unload 4 or 5 headshots from a shotgun directly into an opponent's face without it having any effect of any sort. The result: You get killed with a one-shot from a pistol, you end up having to buy a replacement keyboard and/ or mouse and/ or monitor, and you may even end up uninstalling the game in a fit of rage, only to install it again a few months later in the misguided hope of the game having improved to the point where your gaming rig wouldn't be at risk of high velocity impact with a hammerfist or forehead.
- Network lag. Dear lord, the network lag. I'll paint the scene: You have a perfect opportunity to unleash the fury of a thousand suns upon an unsuspecting enemy player. You line up the enemy and confirm that your AR is in full-auto. You click, expecting to hear an orchestra of gunshots and seeing a thick red mist of blood splatter, except the shots you're firing halt abruptly, your character freezes, the screen dims slightly, and you're greeted with a message stating ""Network lag detected"". HOWEVER, the network lag is not bad enough to prevent you from seeing the enemy player lining you up in cinema-smooth movement, taking shot after shot at you at leisure, then finally seeing the enemy looting what is now the miserable, lifeless corpse of what used to be your character. Loads of fun, this particularly.


Conclusion:
Can be fun, frustrating, and infuriating in equal measure. It's an unfinished game being sold as a finished product. Will it ever be finished? Doubt it. PUBG ever reaching a finished and polished state is this generation's Half Life 3: Maybe it will happen one day, maybe it won't. It probably won't.",1531547114,1531547114,False,3,0,0.550137221813201904,0,True,False,False

Those were the golden days of this game- early access, before release. Despite the performance being pretty awful and there existing a few bugs, it was playable. And that is how I racked up 600+ hours in only 6 months. I made so many memories playing this simple but addicting game. 

And then came Fortnite. No, my interests didn't shift from PUBG to that other battle royale ripoff, but what its surging popularity did do was strike panic in Bluehole. They began trying to compete with Epic Games, no longer having the leverage of being on top. They began changing game dynamics to try and speed up the games, rewarding players who went for crates with new, strong weapons. This wasn't a problem at the time. It didn't achieve the effect Bluehole was going for, games stayed long, as short as 30 minutes and as long as 50. That's what made this game different, longer games. Nobody had quarrels with them, except seemingly for Bluehole.

Around the release of the game in December 2017 and January 2018, its maximum popularity, there came a surge of cheaters and hackers which completely ruined gameplay and I decided the game was no longer worth my time. I made the decision to wait it out, and let Bluehole implement new security measures and ban these cheaters. I took a multiple month hiatus. That was the last time I would play PUBG as I knew it.

I recently decided to play the game a few weeks ago, and what I found wasn't the same game with that same charm which engrossed me for 600 hours. I found a game where SMGs reigned supreme over all other weapons which had recoil so bad it made them unusable. I found paid lootcrates and keys, which I hoped had stopped at the Invitational crates. And now, event passes, the latest slap in the face by a Bluehole company which now seemingly cares too much about competing with Fortnite, even if that means alienating the playerbase which is solely attributed to its successes in later 2017. The same playerbase which broke 3,000,000 concurrent players. The same playerbase which they're banning for reasons they cannot disclose in order to ""maintain the integrity of their anticheat"", whatever that means. The same playerbase that they're now screwing over with microtransactions and shifts in the core gameplay.

Then let me start on the optimization of this game, I have upgraded my pc to run this game at 100+ FPS, since then they have some minor optimizing but what they constantly ignore is all the bugs ingame, like getting stuck on a wall while trying to land after parachuting, or the insane amount of times I was riding a bike, launch over a wall, then randomly explode while not having taking any vehicle damage, or let me not get started on the amount of times that I have gotten stuck in walls or fences, you end up floating inside a wall or a fence just because you jumped up against it, then you naturally need your mates to come knock you down in hopes that you will fall out of the wall (sometimes this works, sometimes...) and then ofcourse the latest changes to the weapons which has completely ruined the balance of the game, UMP's and Vectors are now the strongest weapons in the game purely because they have next to NO recoil what-so-ever, so forget using your assault rifles, pick up those tiny little SMG's and go wreck anyone that has not managed to adjust from the assault rifles.

Long story short, I dont advise this game to anyone that expects good development or even if you are expecting some sort of realism to the game, there is absolutely nothing realistic about this game, I cannot count the amount of times that I have heard jokes about this terrible optimization and the so called physics of the game.

[*]Moving the character is delayed and lazy, physics of a character are so terrible. Just try to jump and you will see a man that can fly like with a jetpack; Or run downstairs and it will knock you off, teleport backwards or forward
[*]Enemies like to survive 3 shots from a shotgun from 2m distance straight into the chest and then kill you with a 9mm pistol
[*]Vaulting is terrible, whenever you want to go quickly through a window or jump over an obstacle, you just can't. You will be jumping in front of a window like retarded frog and taking shots
[*]Hitting a invisible obstacle when driving a car is quite comon
[*]Some animations are glitchy
[*]Bluehole seems like don't care about players complaining
[*]Loot boxes that you have to pay to open
[*]CHEATERS and HACKERS, no anticheat provided
[*]Bushes have silouete exactly like a player
[*]Hitboxes. What it means you ask? Don't ask Bluehole 'cause they have no idea...
[*]Flash grenades jump like a freaking bounce ball
[*]Weapon damage is just one big WTF
[*]Map design is absolutelly terrible, a lot of areas where you get stuck on something, can't get over something or out of something
[*]Not about skill, but just pure luck

[*]Opening a doors with your shotgun, because unfortunately you just can't use your hands
[*]Loot spawning after you came accross it
[*]Enemy player not registering that you shotted him, instead he just 180° snap onto your head and oneshot you (even with a lvl2 helmet)
[*]Death cam showing that you didn't shoot a single bullet, but in reallity you did
[*]Death cam showing that the enemy took a hit into his head but not a single damage taken
[*]Other players movement is laggy
[*]Did some research, 15Hz server avarage? For real? How can they even sleep at night?

The rampant cheating has completely killed my motivation to play this game.

Back in season 1 and 2, it seemed that Bluehole were getting to grips with the cheating problem and I was enjoying myself, but they've since dropped the ball and I'm finding myself losing one in three games to aim-assist, ESP, and invincibility hacks. This isn't just limited to China and Russia; I've witnessed three western Twitch streamers actively using aim-assist cheats (and one case of partial invincibility) and there doesn't seem to be any sign of bannings or a solution.

It's a shame because the game is great. The majority of the bugs have been fixed, the gameplay's solid, and whenever you find yourself in a fair firefight it's intense and fun. I personally prefer the slightly slower pace of PUBG to games like Apex and Fortnite as you're rewarded for mid-long term planning and you can make it quite far with tactics alone.

The PUBG ship appears to have sailed, but if you're still thinking about getting this, I would strongly advise holding off and keeping an eye on the Steam reviews until you see an obvious turnaround.

For a game that when it was released was so poorly optimised had so many horrible bugs and such an awful server set ups surely it could only get better. 2 years on and the awful server set ups don't exist, in fact if you want to play this game in the oceanic region you're forced to play SEA AS or NA servers where you generally die a second after peaking due to the games characteristic d-sync and huge ping to these servers located somewhere on the other side of the world. you're not even given the option to wait for OC players to actually have a playable game, fun.

Now 2 years later on a 9900k, 2080Ti and 32GB of memory I still crash several times daily playing this game, the only upside is that apparently its such a common problem and instead of you know, actually fixing it... the devs have just added a function to rejoin the game you crashed out of, YAY. Although its totally useless seems their crash reported generally takes 45-60 seconds and when you crash you keep running in whatever direction you where facing when you crashed so you're always dead, but hey you can still spectate your team and tell them what happens to their character when they inevitably crash too! I'll briefly mention cheaters and aim bots, third person mode is unplayable which is the original format of the game, there is such a prevalence of cheaters that these games always end in instant death to headshot through several walls or mountains or other terrain which someone else has disabled in their game files so they can instantly shot anyone in their line of sight.. so much fun!

I hate losing so often to people completely unaffected by smoke or flash-bang affects. Cheaters ruin me on this game almost completely. I may stop playing. 

It's second detracter are the glitches. I dont know how many times ive been driving along, minding my own business, when suddenly i kill myself with a vehicle while driving it. Other times it will explode from striking no object. 

Most importantly of all, however, are the match making processes. I'll ""play"" for an hour, and MIGHT get two fair rounds between those rounds which last only minutes because of wall or aim hackers.

Again, fun game. However these points being so, this game is very nearly unplayable. It often isn't. Servers being too full to even play just kill this game for me.",1540789717,1545448838,False,4,0,0.548979282379150391,2,True,False,False

Not enough is being done to prevent hacking in this game or deter others from hacking, such as for example, banning mom/dad's credit card from rebuying this game for their emotionally neglected kid(s) and or banning their home IP address from even using steam. 

Also the keys needing to be purchased for opening crates which initially costs BattlePoints will piss you off too. If you found this review helpful you might experience spending your 30 dollars as a donation to me more enjoyable rather than playing this game.

Most of the assets are barely scaled properly, all bought off the Unreal engine store, the servers/netcode are all bad, half the game is spent rubber banding and lagging, who wins the engagements for the first half of the match is already extremely RNG, and then for the second half of the match the servers settle down to acceptable levels (mostly) however you have to deal with the game's horrible stiff shooting, probably among the worst feeling and performing shooting ive tried on an unreal game, hard to believe this game is on the same engine as the new Unreal Tournament game that has excellent shooting.

This is saying nothing of the game's shit performance though not that big an issue for my PC, it is for others, then you got stuff like picket fences that you should obviously be able to shoot through or fucking metal bars or chairs that shouldn't block bullets BLOCKING BULLETS, an example of this game's lack of detail is how the license plates on the vehicles are modern Polish license plates but the game obviously takes place in some former USSR backwater area of Russia with Russian names n Cyrillic in the towns and shit (probably following DayZ's lead with Chernarus, but that map is actually quite detailed because Bohemia, unlike Blueballs are good at that sorta stuff).

Overall you're better off playing Fortnite since it's developed by people with experience in shooters and that know what they're doing, unlike PUBG which is developed by badly paid asset flipping former MMO developers, when you die in a game like Siege or CS or Insurgency even though one is run by Ubisoft, it's probably your fault because those games' shooting and servers are top notch.

When you die in PUBG it's almost always thanks to server RNG/games horrid optimization fucking you over, it's not a well made game and I doubt it will be in the future considering Bluehole can take my spot for one of the shittiest developers in history, all the money in the world can't save their shitty development.

First of all, the entire loot system is stupidly broken, the first 5 minutes of the game are based off luck. As in, you better get lucky and hope that you parachute doesn't glitch and you end up floating in the sky for 50 seconds, you better hope that your parachute doesn't glitch and when you land you die of ""fall damage"", you better hope that SOMEHOW everyone else lands faster then you. Best of all, you better hope you get some loot. The last game i ever played, i landed in one of the most popular buildings in a very populated area, no guns, no pistols, not armour, only ext mags and a bag, though the entire two story massive building, as soon as i leave, boom one tappted. The first five minutes is based around luck of the draw, not skill.

Furthermore, the fucking Asians are ruining this game, it is almost impossible to get into a game with a Chinese hacker who kills you and then screams ""fuck you nigger, China number 1"" over and over and over. And when the game is not overrun by Asians, you will mostlikely die from a glitch.

The last and final issues can easily be solved, but if you have your mics turn on at the start of the game or when you die, prepare to have between 1-5 people mic spamming but literally screaming at the top of their lungs for the entire 50 second waiting peiod.

Oh and don't worry, when someone kills you they will mostlikely walk over and say

2: i hope your mum gets raped
3: stupid nigger
4: trash cunt, you suck
5: china number 1

I understand it. The game can be very, very addicting and awesome. There are stituations that can be challenging and rewarding if you survive, and solo/duo/squad modes each have their own special moments. 
This is the first battle royal game I have ever played. And at first I rly liked it. But the reason I give this a thumbs down is:

The game is not ready. There are a lot of issues with this game but two of them are the major things that bug me:

 1. People move like robots. There is so much lag, desync and unpretended movement, that the close combat is just impossible. You have to have perfect internet connection if you want to survive the opening lags ( the game lags for a pretty long time after the jump from plane)
 2. It doesnt look good. You have to have minimum settings to have at least 40 fps. And even if you put the best settings on and enjoy the 15 fps, the game still doesnt look that great. I have a pretty good PC and yet this is the only game where I rly need to lower graphics settings.

I am sad that this is ""the game"" of the year. I quess they are trying to launch it on december so they can try to get the awards. But it doesnt deserve it. Even if Twitch is full of popular streamers playing this garbage. We can only hope that some day us gamers learn that these early access games need to be left alone, to rot or to be finished patiently and to be well made and well tested. Not just for easy money.

And that has wildly changed. Before you spend your money, I want to let you know of a few items.

~ Loot Crates can only be unlocked by spending $2.50 IRL cash, per key. You can get Crates at a rather rapid pace, which is pointless if you don't pay to unlock them. Pretty damn low devs.

~ Frequent disconnects. I personally haven't had any trouble in the game, but when leaving a game and hitting the main lobby. It disconnects, a lot. Sometimes you can't even reconnect.

~ The Season Pass. Absolute BS. If you don't purchase it, you can earn prizes, but you can't collect them. On top of this, it doesn't even work correctly.

~ Hackers. I personally haven't noticed any. The only thing I have noticed is when parachuting. I like to drop in more remote places to get established. During drop, there isn't anyone around. No one even lands near you. Suddenly, there they'll be, already geared up and coming around the corner. Makes no sense...

~ Bullet drop. I am not complaining about it existing, in fact I actually like the realism. The problem I DO have is the complete randomness of it though. You can unload an entire magazine from an automatic shotgun, point-blank, yet still somehow miss your opponent. There's something wrong w/ that.

~ Covering headshots. I have been prone lying on the heighest point of a ledge, in no way visible to anyone... And die from a headshot. It's not, ""Oh, you're head was sticking out somehow."" No... It'd be physically impossible to be killed where I was.

~ Vaulting. I love vaulting. What I do not love is how selective it can be. You'll get frustrated as you go to vault and simply jump in front of the window a few times before eventually grabbing it.

~ Vehicles. Vehicles are awesome. What isn't awesome are the hidden ""ledges"" hidden in flat terrain that slam you into an invisible brick wall. Motorcycles will randomly cartwheel and throw you off, if not killing you.

~ Advertisements. Yes, advetisements. Buildings and even the plane itself are now loaded w/ PGI 2018 ads. Everywhere. I get it, but keep the crap out of the game and leave it in the lobby.

PuBG used to be great. Even then it had its flaws, but they were easily looked over. When Fortnite was released, the devs of PuBG got greedy. End of story. They're using the game to cash grab what they can, while they can.

Such an absolute shame. So disappointing to support a game and then see them join the EA bandwagon. Good going guys.",1530212913,1530212913,False,5,0,0.547416806221008301,0,True,False,False

If you can accept this then the game is probably a great multiplayer game.

However again the developers are complete utter trash, the Vikendi battle pass is a big joke to all its players, obligating you to buy levels in order to reach high levels, and no this is not ok when we compare it to Dota 2's battle pass where you can easily level up by being good at the game and doing other stuff and reach enough high level to get sweet exclusive rewards and maybe even get back some or all of your money if lucky thanks to the steam market.
We can even compare it to Fortnite's battlepass, which I spent only $5 on (had basically $4 gotten by free from past seasons) then i could reach level 100 by not even being good at the game but doing easy, simple and mostly gameplay focused objectives like kill 3 people with a shotgun, then I could buy the next pass, reach level 100, now i bought another pass and i will obviously reach level 100 without spending any more than $5.

I enjoyed the f*** out of this game right until version 1.0

They not only made the glitches worse but also introduces things like: broken matchmaking, a billion hackers and unbalanced guns.

The games drag out way too long and just aren't fun, you collect loot for 10 minutes then you walk get shot or shoot someone and walk some more.
This could be forgiven tho but instead of fixing this the devs just keep making it worse and worse every single patch.

First there came a second map which was fine, until you realize you can't choose which map you play, then came the third which was fun but they also introduced micro transactions battle passes and even more glitches and performance issues,
with the fourth map on the horizon It isn't looking all that good.

But the biggest problem of them all is the fact that they made a even called Fix PUBG, an event designed for fixing the game. this is already bad but after 4 months and the event ending they fixed less than 10% of the bugs.
The game still isn't optimized, has glitches, hackers, drags out way too long and has more micro transactions than fifa.
Instead of fixing this they just keep adding guns thinking its fresh and exciting while you still just disconnect mid game from time to time.

I am by no means a dedicated player, and nor do I have the intention of being, so this is purely from the experience and viewpoint of a ""casual"" player, someone who mostly plays for fun with friends, but has at least experienced a decent number of chicken dinners.

I want to be able to give a positive recommendation for the game, I truly do, but as it stands I am worried that some of the design decisions for the game are taking it away from the niche which is what initially brought people in to begin with, and instead making more and more decisions that seem to bring it more in line with a deathmatch FPS. Maybe this is what people want, I don't know, but I got into this game for the Battle Royale experience, the tactical decision making that can bring you either glorious victory or horrible defeat, if I wanted a pure deathmatch, run at the opponents and die over and over, I'd play CoD or Battlefield, or whatever it is the kids play these days, but I don't.

Making smaller maps and trying to focus gameplay into a few minutes of action in ""hotspots"" just makes the rest of the game become more and more stale, I understand why this is happening, they look to youtube and streamers, who cater to an action needing audience, and this influences the game in the wrong direction. You only have to look at the now-reverted changes they made to quicken the bluezone as an indication that this isn't what the playerbase want. People want to drop in a place, gear up, whether they want to fight for it or not, and then out-think their opponents, out position, out gun, and ultimately out perform them to pick up a win. That is what feels good, and they should take this into consideration rather than trying to force a faster pace of the game.

While we're at it, let's discuss the maps. Initially, the original map was my favourite... when Miramar came out, I disliked it, I thought, it's too easy to spot people, the guns are worse, etc etc, but as time went on, my viewpoint did a 180, and Miramar became by far my favourite, the hills never fail to allow for decent positioning if you care to go for those spots, and there are always a smattering of buildings available regardless of where you land, whereas it feels like in Erangel... there are huge stretches of open field which are basically like a no-mans land, run across them at your peril. I would love to see Erangel revamped with their newer map design in mind, but we'll see. We still have a ways to go before that's considered, I'm betting. I won't even bother with Sanhok, because as stated... I just don't like the idea of the smaller map. A personal preference probably.

So yeah, while I would like to give a positive recommendation, I can't. I am genuinely concerned with the state of the game, and while I do still play it, I'm not entirely sure I could in good conscience advise people to buy it when the future of the game is uncertain to me. There are other battle royale games coming into their own now, and I fear that rather than focus on bringing PUBG into a better place, Bluehole are just gonna keep pushing the game into the wrong direction.

Oh, and if you do buy the game. Never, and I do mean NEVER, get into a trike unless you are prepared for the game to flip you in every direction it can before instant killing you. I don't know what the hell they did to the physics engine to cause these things to happen, but the bike with the sidecar is a deathtrap that has ended many a run.",1532366655,1532367022,False,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

But: Instead of fixing bugs, optimizing the game, banning hackers rightfully (not the casual players) and making the game actually enjoyable - they introduce more payed crates, a premium pass, they ban people randomly and don't even think about listening to the community. 
Even worse: They sue Fortnite, a game that doesn't suit me but does everything so much better than PUBG, just because they overcame them in player number. You would guess.

I will not play until they stop being such a cash cow. The way they milk this game is disgusting.

There has been some really fun moments playing with friends. The gameplay is fun and the game looks sweet.

I have an issue though. The game is just not optimised as well as it should be. Some people can hate on this comment but if you are going to release a game and enhance it's price it means that people expect a more polished version of the game. WHICH means testing more on the test servers before releasing to the official servers. 

I enjoyed and 'played' through the performance issues of the game a lot but there gets a point where it's too much.

As of this current update (22.2.18) with the new spring cases ect, the game feels unplayable. Jitters, it's really terrible. Myself and my friends played one round and quit afterwards, and went to other games.

I think it's great that games in alpha/beta are able to get to certain points to welcome a big community and become playable games, but in pubg there remains an issue that the game still requires many updates impacting performance. It saddens me. PUBG I hope you're doing the best you can. Use more money on resources to optimise the game, smash the bugs, make the game polished. Otherwise I guarantee you will see more people going to Fortnite, why? Because it's optimised.

I recommend this game only to those who are patient enough to deal with regular updates that can affect the quality of gameplay you have. It's heavy on hardware (I have a 1080ti atm from 75-60) and those things alone can be quite frustrating. Otherwise the game is fun. I'm sorry but I'm going to have to give a downvote at this point in time.

There's no reason to jump into PUBG at this point in its lifespan. Too many cheaters, too poor graphics, too few Quality of Life updates, too poor optimization, too much bullshit.

I love this game, it's fun, it's tense, chaotic, and the skill curve is crazy. Winning a chicken dinner is so incredibly satisfying. Collecting loot, strategizing with friends, landing a long-range shot or clinching a close-quarters battle is so intensely good. 

Why am I not recommending it at this time? Cheaters. In my 10+ years gaming online, I have never encountered this many cheaters in a game. Before playing this game, I can accurately say I've only run into 4 cheaters online in all my games, on all my platforms total. If I play 10 matches of PUBG, it's normal for me to get gunned down by a cheater from China in more than 6 or 7 of those games. It's rampant, it kills the fun I used to have before the game was sold in China. I've put 100+ hours into this game, and I'd love to play it more, but dropping into a game that lasts almost half of an hour, getting a few kills, getting super geared up, having a great battle plan, etc, only to get sniped by a guy who had no scope, line of sight, or even a proper weapon is too disheartening, too frustrating, and too common for me to want to play much anymore. Until the developers start effectively using BattleEye like Rainbow Six does (booting cheaters instantly from matches instead of waiting) or region locking Chinese players to their own separate, cheat-riddled server, I can't recommend this game at all.

UPDATE: Cheaters are a little less likely now, but still rampant. Highly recommend picking up the F2P and not Pay-To-Win Ring of Elysium instead, it's PUBG with several quality of life changes, and even playing on an overseas server, it still has better hit detection, better weapon balance, and is more fun.

Second update: Definitely still would recommend Ring of Elysium or Apex Legends over this. Paying out the kind of dough this game wants to have a less polished, less fun, and more cheater-filled experience than games that are literally free is ridiculous. It may have been the first BR to make it really big, but the fact is, other games are doing the genre better with more substantial updates much faster and with an overall smoother experience.",1519199866,1549861612,False,3,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

However I have noticed a larger influx of chinese hackers since the offical release and many of the recent reviews tend to have the same story. If PUBG Corp does not get their banning/reporting system up to par this may lead to a decrease of players playing this game which is a shame since this game is beautifully flawed in a way and I get the impulsive love for this game.

1. The North American server is overrun with Chinese players which creates a number of problems other than the obvious language barrier trying to coordinate during a gun battle
2. While I will admit that the majority of the Chinese players are friendly I also have noticed a drastic uptick in teamkilling. I have been team killed by my Chinese team members more times in one weekend than than I ever was in the first 6 months of the games release
3. Cheaters, cheaters, and more cheaters ...no explanation needed ( see numer one above )
4. The game has some serious lag issues and the worst part of the lag seems to be at the very begining when players are landing and everyone is scrambling for a weapon/gun which is the ABSOLUTE the worst time you want to experience lag.
5. The latest release has introduced a number of bugs which by themselves are not deal breakers, they do add to the overall fustration level when combined with previous points.

The game can be entertaining with some of the funny things that occur in the game from time to time, but overall I have to give the game a thumbs down until at the very minimum the cheating is under control. Some people claim that there are not alot of cheaters...but considering that matches have 100 players...it only takes 1 cheater to ruin the fun for 99 other players.

I was falsely banned by the devs. Not one of those ""my brother was playing and he cheated I swear it wasn't me!"" or ""oops I left my mods for *other game* running!"" false bans, but a straight up ""I logged on and was banned"" ban.

Innocence is impossible to prove, but I know what my situation is and nobody else does, so if you happen to read this and think ""obviously you were cheating"" then you can stop here.

However, what really ticks me off about this false ban is the developer's refusal to cooperate. I have made support tickets on both their forum and their official helpdesk, and in both cases my response was simply ""our evidence supports the initial ban claim, it has been reviewed and the ban will stay"". What evidence? Supposedly they can't provide evidence as ""hackers can use it to their advantage"", I think the reality in my case is that there is no evidence.

I have clearly been banned by some kind of false flag in their anticheat, BattlEye, as one look at my statistics or a typical game would show you that I'm not even that great at the game, I highly doubt someone saw my behaviour and reported me. So this automated system assumedly has me banned, and the support staff thoroughly believes that it can do no wrong. Great...

There are tons of false ban reports out there on the Steam forums for this game, on their official forums, and in just about every reply to BattlEye on Twitter. I'm sure that while many of these are people who were in fact cheating, the sheer numbers say to me that SOME of these people, like me, must surely have been innocent.

Still, the developers refuse to believe their bans can be mistaken, so I'm missing the money I paid for this game, and I have a nasty ""1 ban on record"" blemish on my account. It's probably there forever and the only people who can do anything about it vehemently refuse to do anything about it.


So yeah, I'm assuming that you don't want to be locked out of a game you paid for with no evidence or support, so for that reason I can't recommend this game.",1514256999,1514256999,False,2,0,0.547325074672698975,2,True,False,False

(TL;DR at the bottom)

The devs are working to improve how smooth the game runs, load times and etc, and me playing on a low end PC, it definitely shows. Pre 1.0, i still had a fair bit of issues with the game but they've fixed so much, So credit where credit is due.

I love the gameplay, for me it's a kind of unique experience. When you're playing squad mode with your friends, and you run into an enemy squad in the next compound over, and a high intesity firefight begins, it's an awesome rush and it leaves you wanting another engagement like it.

All that being said, the major issues become clear after you've sunk your first 30 hours in.

-Not having a region lock almost encourages players to use a server that's not closest to them for the best ping, for example, Me being an Australian player, could go onto the NA server and abuse my ping. An American player could be behind cover for that split second that could save him, but he is still in view for me.

-The amount of hackers in this game is just horrid, and Yes, they are mostly chinese. Ive watched duo match replays where they were just scoping in on my building from across the other side of a town, Or when you're about 500m out from a town and someone goes full auto on an SKS and hits every single shot in the head from that distance.

Those are my major two negatives currently and it does affect my experience. 

This is a good game, and I'd reccomend definitely buying it, but only when they fix the amount of hackers, and place a region lock in.

TL;DR -  Great game, but give it a miss till they get rid of most of the hackers.",1515311587,1515311633,False,4,0,0.547216296195983887,0,True,False,False

This game...where do i begin...when i first heard about it back in early 2017 i thought to myself ""hey here's the game thats gonna be an actual good version of H1Z1"". The battle royale concept is a really cool idea and i really like it. However....

After over a year of owning this game, I have been NOTHING BUT DISSAPOINTED with the development. 

There are TOO MANY CHEATERS, TOO MANY BUGS, and worst of all the stupid useless ""DLC"" that is a cut and paste copy of fortnite's event pass system is just a complete slap in the consumers' face by BlueHole. They have shown that they absolutely do not care about what is wrong with the game and only prioritize content that will make them more money, which means SKINZ SKINZ and more SKINZ.

Many good ideas ruined by terrible bugs and bad developers.  This game is riddled with bugs that are not going away anytime soon, the developers are lazy and greedy, and you're better off waiting for a more experienced competitor to release a battle royal game with a more similar look and feel to PUBG than Fortnite. It's seriously only a matter of time.

Hell, if Konami decided to do something actually intelligent, they could create a Battle Royale game in the Fox Engine using assets from MGSV and Survive, and it'd be 10 times better than this.

[h1]Engine[/h1]
PUBG Corp clearly has no idea what they're doing, because this game is bugged to the core.  Instead of trying to fix these bugs deep within the code and pay off their ""tech debt,"" PUBG Corp decided that it would be a much better idea to create more content for the game in the form of maps, gamemodes, weapons, paid-for DLC, locked crates, etc.  The result isn't surprising: the game is buggy as hell even after being called ""1.0.""  Feels more like a beta because of how buggy it is.  It is not optimized in any sense of the word, and this is by far the biggest problem of this game.  

One of the worst feelings in the world is when you're doing well in a match, but you end up dying to buggy car physics, getting stuck in geometry, or some other glitch rathen than actually being killed by a more skilled opponent.  It's like being spit in the face by God, and it happens often enough for it to be infuriating.

The game also has a penchant for taking a very long time to load assets at the beginning of the match.  Have fun glitching through poorly rendered buildings trying to pick up invisible items during the first 30-60 seconds.  It's great.

If PUBG Corp does not fix these problems, another company WILL swoop in and WILL make a very similar but far superior gameplay experience.  Just look at how everyone already flocked to Fortnite.  As soon as a better developer makes a pseudo-milsim battle royale game similar to PUBG, it's curtains for PooHole.  I would [b]highly[/b] recommend waiting for this to happen if you don't like the look and feel of Fortnite.  Why do you think BrownHole is trying to sue everyone who makes battle royale games on planet Earth?  BungHole knows their game sucks, and the only reason why so many people play(ed) it was because it was the only popular battle royale experience.  BluesClues built their house out of twigs and chewing gum, it's only a matter of time before someone walks by, kicks it over, and builds a sturdy brick house on the rubble.

[h1]Look and Feel[/h1]
It's a real shame that this game is such a mess since BlueHole did a great job capturing a pseudo-milsim experience.  The bullet physics are good, and the sounds are gorgeous.  They implemented nice-sounding supersonic cracks from bullets as opposed to Hollywood bullet whizzing and other nice details.  The aiming system is also very nice, hold to zoom and click to ADS.  Bullets actually come from the barrels of the gun rather than from the center of your camera.  If you're not careful, you will end up shooting what you're hiding behind rather than over it.  You must also take care to sight in your weapons effectively.  If you're in third person and behind cover trying to aim at someone, but your gun is actually pointed at what you're hiding behind rather than at your adversary, the game will indicate this with a little marker showing where your bullet will actually go, like in MGSV.  A nice touch.

Game options are also excellent, and they allow you to change many of the controls to a powerful extent.  Want to hold right mouse to ADS instead of clicking?  No problem.  Want to hold or click M to bring up the map?  They have you covered.  They put [b]a lot[/b] of thought and effort making sure that you can customize the controls to how [i]you[/i] prefer to play, and I must commend them for it.  You can personalize your controls and really make them yours.  Graphical options and FOV slider are also great.  

The above features are truly excellent, and make the downsides of the game so much more disappointing.  Unfortunately, as good as they are, they don't make up for the game's flaws.

Movement is very glitchy, especially with the climbing and vaulting system.  Expect to rubber band a lot when traversing rough terrain or using the climb/vault system.  Don't climb the rocks or you might get stuck on them with no way to escape :0)

The game also lacks things like combat rolls, dives, etc. and leaves you wanting more ways to maneuver and escape danger.

[h1]Community and Cheating[/h1]
The game is filled to the brim with cheaters.  BattleEye hardly works to stop them.  Expect to die to cheaters in many of the matches where you don't die to glitches.  The community in general is very toxic, annoying, and childish.  As to be expected with any ""competitive"" game.  Expect to get yelled at over VOIP by raging 10-20 year olds for camping in buildings or using other strategies that are part of the game.  Being good at video games is very important to them, as being good in video games opens up many doors for a bright future.  If you kill them in these ""unfair"" ways, their death is 100% your fault and not theirs.  For shame.  You should feel bad for being such a bad person and being bad at the game.  Maybe you should learn to play PUBG properly like them, the person who just died.

If you (for whatever stupid reason) actually get this game, just turn voice communications to squad-only or turn it off completely.  Trust me.

[h1]Greed[/h1]
The game is filled with locked loot crates, and it's getting a bit ridiculous with the new Event Pass.  Why would anyone want to spend money getting cosmetics in such an unpolished, unoptimized mess of a game?

BlueBalls is also suing Epic Games and many other battle royale competitors for that sweet sweet $$$.  Remember, no other video games are allowed to have frying pans in them since BungHole literally invented frying pans in video games.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]Don't buy this game.[/b]
PUBG is flawed to the core and it's only a matter of time before an actually half-competent developer creates a similar and more optimized game.  PUBG is too buggy to be enjoyable.  Expect to be frustrated, not happy, when playing this game.  The community, the glitches, everything about it will leave a bad taste in your mouth.

Horrible stuttering on a high end PC, bullet mechanics are sub par, the new map is so poorly thought out.

Random drops where you take near to full damage before the game has even started, vehicles getting stuck in places they shouldn't.

Instead of trying their best to keep players coming back it seemed more like they were more interested in trying to get more money from their players.  

My biggest issue with bluehole is their decision to allow people to buy skins off the market but not trade them.  THIS IS PURELY FOR GREADY REASONS.  When this decision was made in my humble opinion marked the day that PUBG as a game pretty much initiated its own death.  I personally purchased some items $150 worth of items off the steam marketplace a day before they permently disabled trading and was gonig to gift them to one of my friends who loved the game as a birthday present as he lives halfway across the world.   You can imagine my dissapointment to discover the next day that Bluehole without asking the community or any sort of heads up or anything permently disabled trading of all ingame items.

Honestly I can't recommend the game in it's current state for a few reasons.

-  #1 the Lagggggg. You start rubberbanding as soon as you drop unless you drop all alone. It stays that way for a good few minutes until the population goes down to around 75-80. In any other game that factor alone would be cause enough for people to never buy it unless it got fixed, just look at R6:S where it's held to a much higher standard and if there's any sort of lagging or rubberbanding it is a major cause for complaint on the sub-reddit.
 
- #2 kinda to go along with #1 is the Hit Registration, you constantly get shot around corners, in cover, and when the person isn't even looking at you. This is due in part to the EXTREMELY LOW TICKRATE!! An average of 17 Hz which is even lower than Fortnite which is it's comic relief brother. When PUBG is supposed to be an eventual ESports game and it can't even run better than a FREE TO PLAY game there is a problem. The lowest of 8 Hz at the start and going up to around 20 Hz after the first 30 people die it is borderline unplayable in a competitive aspect. 

-And WORST of all, #3 THE GOD DAMN HACKERS!!! Not only is this game supposed to be competitive which means you need to talk to your squad mates and support eachother (which is damn near impossible considering Chinese players outnumber Americans on the NA Servers) . It almost doesn't matter when you have someone that either doesn't take any damage, doesn't have any recoil (Now you can actually verify this in the replay features) or they just have constant aim/wall hacks. Yes Battle Eye is working on it but considering the fact that Battle Eye has banned 1.5 MILLION PEOPLE out of the 28 MILLION PEOPLE that purchased the game as of writing this (Using Steamspy) that means that on AVERAGE you are getting 5% of people you play with being hackers. And that's just the amount of people Battle Eye has caught so far. So ON AVERAGE you are playing with 5 HACKERS IN YOUR GAME!!!!!!!!

- Unacceptable. I don't honestly understand why this game is so popular and why there are so many people still buying it and for god's name why 28 Million people have wasted their money on this ""game"".",1515744155,1515744155,False,3,0,0.546313822269439697,0,True,False,False

Funny thing is, bluehole doesn't give a damn and here's the reason why:

1. They locate a popular hack and generate a usage statistic for this specific hack.
2. They wait until the hack usage spike falls and equalizes (up to this point, no one was banned).
3. Now they'll ban everyone who was using that hack.
4. Every cheater will now require a new account (this generates a lot of game sales for them, or in other words... money).
5. After generating a lot of game sales by banning those hackers, they'll just wait for the next big hacking tool to emerge.
6. Now they'll repeat this very process.

There's no good intension behind this, instead of generating more money. If you really wanted to make a game free of cheating, you could include machine learning algorithms and code with some very basic multiplayer coding guidelines (ex. not accepting any data from the client that has nothing to do with required movement or aim position commands, like player health).

Funny thing is, this happens with any multiplayer shooter. 
More cheaters = more banned players = more sold games = more money for the developers.
It’s as simple as this and their greed disgusts me.

Edit: It's been a while since I wrote this review. Now, in March 2018 the game has lost the monopole of a good BR game with Fortnite Early Access on the other side. I can clearly recommend to anyone, who wants to play a rather tilt-free, chilling and fun game: Get Fortnite first. If you like it, MAYBE try out PUBG. If you dont like Fortnite, MAYBE as well try out PUBG. Games are totally different from the way you have to play them to actually win, Fortnite is a lot more fast paced, wild and hectic compared to a rather slow gameplay in PUBG. PUBG has a rather more realistic setting (can't say PUBG is realistic, but in comparison to Fortnite, this is da real stuff), but as well a slower movement mechanic. Fortnite offers the feature of creating cover right when you need, while in PUBG you are caught in the open, when caught in the open. 

So, you are forced to think about your next step, next move or next shot a bit. Might be a game for some high level tacticians who are calculating every possibility and then decide where to go and what to do. Yet, problems I mentioned in the review are still there, are still relevant to me. The issue with the community is something you hope to have it resolve itself, but I think it has become less cancerous nowadays. Anyway, read below for the shortened version of my review or even lower to read the full review. Thank you.

 TL;DR [spoiler]I've been playing since the closed beta, did enjoy it very much even with its bugs. Those were annoying, sure, but not as annoying as such a huge community with mostly stupid, far too young, and cheating people. The reasonable, good and nice players have become a minority just as in CS:GO. A community this big, an anti-cheat system banning players after they have played 150 hrs+ and a horrible launch are beautiful signs of self-destruction. Money has been made, the game can die slowly now. [/spoiler]

First: The new map: YOU CANT DECIDE WHETHER YOU WANT TO PLAY IT?! - Way to open, there is no cover, no structure, no chance to play the game in your style. If you like to go for a slow approach, loot and chill, you can't. There is not enough loot on the borders of the map or in smaller areas to have a slight chance of reaching even top 20. If you like to rush for kills like an idiot, again a loot problem. Luck has always been a factor, but on Miramar you need more luck than gamesense or skill to kill others. 

If you want to have a smooth mixture of going for the kill and staying patient you're either getting gunned down by a rushing dude you've never seen or heard before thanks to so much other noises on this map, or your getting sniped from 300, 400, 1000m. Probably with an AK. Silenced. 8x. The new map has so many flaws, you can either chill in a house with a shotgun to win the game or snipe yourself into madness. Once your position is given away, you're immediately getting raped by 3, 4 people shooting at you from a fair distance. Seems like fun, nah thanks.


Second: It's been getting worse since I started playing. Every now and then there was a patch or an update, older bugs have been fixed (sometimes) and new have occured that made it worse to play, gave you worse performance or ended up in some other bullsh*t. The game has crashed frequently since then, it still does way too often for a launched game, and it always will crash. The Patch-Support is there, yea. But it's like not supporting that much, sadly. 

A little Gameplay-Side-Note: So, when having a brainstorm on other negative aspects, I noticed that the gameplay totally suffered over time. The decision, to make a spray pattern completely unpredictable was so weird in the first place and made rifles right from the start a nice yet weak option. But implementing Marksmen-Rifles (SKS, Mini-14,...) made Rifles so irrelevant. You won't need a rifle to win the game, you could aswell go with a marksmen and a pistol/SMG. The marksmen can deal anything 10m+ everything below is pistol-job. You can spray yourself into oblivion with any Marksmen as they have way too much ammo in a mag and a natural high damage output. Don't get me wrong, the Marksmen have to be this way. They are fine, but rifles have become to weak to be valuable nowadays. You need way too much time and effort to fully equip your rifle, they are inaccurate and have flaws from 100m+ - all this making them irrelevant on the new map Miramar. 

Lastly: The community has gone down to the wire, dear guys. Or has it? I have been experiencing so many far too young players, far too stupid and far too lucky players lately.  Surely, there are still many nice people out there but the pure mass of players, streamers, fans and haters and therefore as well cheaters has made this game AIDS. And being killed by a lucky HS, getting screamers and squeakers in the plane and those people screaming like they're getting bitten by a million snakes in the ballsack is... no words... (YES, there is a mute function, NO I am often playing duo or squad alone and therefore need to hear random teams talking)  Let's have a quick mindgame (I'm making up numbers based on experience and for the cause, but they are actually close to reality);

 In average, you're getting contact with about 10 people in one single SOLO-Q game out of 100. You've been playing a lot lately and now you're taking results; this is where the fun part starts: assuming you haven't made contact with anyone twice and have had every single player each once in your lobby. 
[b]This will result in having played against 100% of all players, but only having made contact with about 10% of them, having died to only 1 % of all players.[/b]

 So, no matter what's your experience with ingame community is, it's wrong. I'm therefore wrong as well, but the amount of times you believe to have been killed by a cheater seems to be so high. At least it's been for me this way, this is just a personal non-fact opinion. 

Whoever read until here - thanks a lot, I appreciate you withstanding my long and painful view to the great game it has been once. Right now, I can not really recommend to buy it, but if you're starting the game now, you might make different experiences than I did. I'm pre-caught by the time in the closed beta, might be influential yet reasonable. I will still continue to play it every once in while and when the fun kicks back in, I'll have this review edited.

Second problem, is more a genre problem than a pugb problem. It's basic common sense. When you play something in the lines of COD, with 10 vs 10 matches, if you have 1000 concurent players where 10% are cheaters, some matches will have cheaters, some will be good. On something like Battlefield, matches have way more people, but because of the objective based nature and diferent skirmishes going on in a single map, you can still dodge the cheaters after you identify them. But on something like pugb, a battle royalle... the same pool of 1000 with 10% cheaters (100) will be divided in 100 men matches. There will be a lot less matches with the same pool of players, andchances for each and every one of them having some of those 10% cheaters increase tremendously. Add to that the battle royalle mechanics where only 1 wins, and you have no way to dodge that one cheater in your 100 men match. Bottom line, in pugb, getting to the last 10 is finding the cheaters. 
Is this cheap, brain dead 1 vs all game, where every match you do nothing but running around for 15/20 minutes to get to a 30 second fire fight against a hand-full of the surviving cheaters and campers of each match(then rinse and repeat all over again), the new shooter genre nirvana?

Liked it when it first came out. But for the reasons others are stating it really, truly is going down hill. 
99% of the dev's focus has been on loot boxes. Took us ages to get a map that is generally unliked. The mobile game has fewer cheaters and better optimization. Loot/weps is not randomized in fact, you are restricted to a few key areas if you want to find anything capable of killing beyond 50 meters. The 'Mostly Negative' reviews are easy to understand, and I'm curious to see what happens when the # of current players drops <500,000....
At this point I think I'll go see what Fortnite has to offer, later on I'll try Strange Brigade.

Its all because the shots dosnt register when are trying to kill someone. I'm still playing this game bcs all of my friends play this game and we are enjoying the first 15min.

You look right and sudenly the enemy is on the left side with 58 other players with him. I start to spray him down with a AKM (keep in mind that im the persone shooting first) while aiming directly on him. I had my sight literally on him the whoal fight and what happend?? He killed me with first. I hade armor and everything. He had nothing but skins he got from his moms creditcard.        Blueballs can do better if they just get they finger out and fix the soundsystem and where the bullet goes. I dont play fortnite but i can say that they are more productive then blueballs, they are nonstop patching the game, adding new things ect and its free, meanwhile you pay 30euro for adhd increas, playing with hackers from asian, a shity soundsystem, shity servers and attempting to break something or punching someone in the face :))).

it had so much potential in the beginning, but it isnt uptimized to its full potential and that for a now fully released game, specially for the fact you have to lower your settings to get that little advantage with the invironment to see players in the grass or bushes, then why should you play the game in its full glory? its useless thats why its useless to the fact it gives you a false view of the game, most games gives you both high graphics and a good game play, this game tho is the total opposite.

I've experienced a lot of issues with PUBG before, but I still enjoy the game. But, is it too late to turn back, and make PUBG great again? Is it too late to bring back the player base? What if the new map doesn't bring back players. Just my thoughts, and I wanted to see if anyone else is thinking the same thing. I would love to hear what everyone else thinks. We're getting closer and closer to PUBG's demise if the developers don't fix these issues. Can we have confirmation that the developers will work on making the game better, and actually fixing these issues?",1548877325,1548877325,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

First off, he can punch through a tree. Actually, he can punch through a block of solid diamond that is one meter on edge in about 30 seconds. He can shatter iron in about that time too. He can build massive structures singlehandedly with nothing but his own two hands and some rudimentary wood/stone/iron tools (diamond tools are unnecessary for building). Oh, and he can fall a distance of 23 meters (about 7 stories) and live.

However, all of that pales in comparison to the sheer amount of shit that this guy can carry.

The heaviest block in Minecraft is a gold block. This is a 1x1x1m block of solid gold. It weighs about 42,500 pounds. No human alive can even carry 5% of that by himself. And that is just 1 block. Steve has 36 inventory slots, and each one holds 64 of those things. So, 42,500x36x64=97,920,000 pounds, or 48,960 tons.

But that's just the tip of the iceberg.

You see, while a gold block is the heaviest BLOCK in the game, there's a heavier object. The level 2 golden apple. It is made of a single apple and 8 gold blocks. And you can carry stacks of these as well, so multiply the last value by 8.

48,960x8=391,680 tons.

BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE!

There is an item called a shulker box. These things are basically storage containers. They fit 27 stacks of an item in them.

Steve can carry 36 of them, one for each inventory slot, so multiply the previous value by 27.

Final capacity: 391,680x27=10,575,360 tons.

To put that in perspective, the great pyramid of Giza weighs approximately 6 million tons.

This guy can carry nearly 2 Great Pyramids of Giza

And the best part?

He doesn't slow down. He can run just as fast with it as he can without it. He doesnt even lose stamina more quickly. It can be inferred then that 10 million tons isn't even close to his true capacity.
..
And don't even get me started on creative mode, where he can fly, is nearly invincible, and technically can hold infinite items....﻿",1546091657,1546091657,False,2,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I feel PUBG has not and seemingly still will not develop the game further; and instead decides making money, adding more skins, guns, stuff and microtransactions (which are only adding more bugs) and cheating its players--which was a huge number, now justifyingly crashing--is more important than developing a great game that runs smoothly and gives everyone but hackers a chance. 

In beta, I though PUBG was the best conceptually designed video game ever. I am still addicted to it. But it is the single worst video game on this planet. I hate it. Because I've been playing since it's Beta release, I've witnessed nearly every development news and patch update on this game. I'm still waiting for them to deliver a game that I can play and not worry about a server maintenance during my free time, only to come back and find nothing integral worked on, and more bugs present.

PUBG is competing with free to play games which are so much more fun with friends, and yet they still dissuade the playerbase with blatant extortion and disregard. I still have a mere speck of hope for this game, because I really want it to be the greatest game ever, as it was leading up to be; but it's simply dissappointing.

let me explain why i still hate this game. i love battle royale, i like how we loot things to make ourself strong for war with weps and armor, make a lot of fun with friends, intense gameplay need a high concetrate, overall its a fun game. But the optimization is just soo bad, i remember there was a huge update for optimizing the game and i feel the different. i but this game when it was beta so i buy PUBG in very early release date on steam, so i had enough experience to this sh*t. when the first time i buy this, i had a problem that i think the others player had this problem too, yep the unrender building. but after that huge update, its gone. my pc can easily render the building. BUT ITS STILL STUTTERING LIKE WHY? i mean, i know we need a high spec PC for this, and i think my pc is strong enough to run this kinda game, but the game need MORE and MORE spec, its just way too HIGH. for this kinda game, its not even a super good graphics game, its just a multiplayer game and can u imagine multiplayer game with super high quality? i mean not all of players can do that. i can play Far Cry 5 for mid-high, AC Origins mid-high, and i think you guys can see how strong my pc can run new games with high graphics. so, the point is, i just can’t enjoy play PUBG, a lot of stuttering, stuck on loading screen, and the most thing i hate is i got stutter when i got HIT, its blow my mind, like how i do the gunfight if my game stutter when i got hit from enemy? like damn son. this game still need a lot of fix for optimizing, i hope really soon!",1538878366,1543338429,False,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

------------------------------------
The first few hours of me playing the game was the most exciting thing of my life, because I wanted to try a Battle Royale game that has a different feel compared to Fortnite. Later on as I continue to play this game, it became increasingly difficult to enjoy this game as a whole. Usually, I would play in squads because I would like to meet more people and I tend to be more at ease when learning the game. But there are many downsides to playing this game in squads (which I would list in my pros and cons list of this review). In addition, I have heard that bugs, glitches, hackers, and many other common problems listed in other reviews is a huge issue in this game; I faced most of these issues (mainly bugs, glitches, hackers, and teamkillers). Here is my pros and cons that I can think of this game,

Pros:
-Variety of weapons
-Multiple game modes
-TPP & FPP
-Variety of vehicles
-Three maps that one can play on (as of the time of this review)
-Being able to play Solo, Duos, Squads, and One-manned Squads.

Cons:
-Laggy Server Issues
-Horrible Anti-Cheating System
-Hackers (related to the Anti-Cheating System; also related to what I experienced in playing in squads)
-Difficulty to learn as one further progresses (something I have experienced)
-High ping players paired with low ping players.
-Updates that are unreasonably large (no pun intended; largest I experienced is 12.9 GB)
-Teamkillers and toxic players in squads(because of that I have to show hostility when I know there is a toxic teammate in squads; I don't intend to be toxic in anyway shape or form unless provoked)
-Useless BP's
-Paid Crates, skins, and recently, Event Passes (which happened during the release of Sanhok)
-Not given the ability to change nicknames (unless there is an event pass that gives a ticket that allows one to change their nickname for a certain amount time; this correlates to what I am experiencing since people are constantly making assumptions off of my username)

In conclusion, I would not recommend playing this game if you are going to play this by yourself. I would recommend that you, the person reading this, should play this with your friends if you want a better experience of playing this game while being able  to learn. Also, I would recommend not spending anymore money than what you are paying for this game.
------------------------------------
Again, I am writing this from the point of view of an amateur player of this game. I know people would say ""Start playing more,"" or ""It's your fault for not playing enough,"" when it comes with describing how hard it is learning the game.

The OC servers haven't worked in months. When asked about it they blatantly removed the OC servers, and now you don't get a choice for which region you want to connect to. So as someone in who lives in Australia, I'm forced to play on servers in Asia or the USA with higher latency.

Then there's the general gameplay bugs. You can easily clip on something while driving and then your vehicle is destroyed. This type of bug has never been fixed.

Other random collision issues on objects when shooting, sometimes you think your shot should clear an object, but because a collision model wasn't done correctly, the bullet will hit something else. Especially prevalent around window frames, the top of fences and walls.

The general player base is terrible. There is no region filter, so a lot of people get stuck with players who don't speak the same language. I've been demanded by Chinese players to speak Chinese on an Australian server.

These are some basic ideas that should have been implemented at the start back in early access.

1. Have a language preference. You should be able to select your native language, and get paired with other people on the same team who speak your language. This will solve the issue of having team mates you can't communicate with. 

2. Default to the server with the lowest ping, but also give the choice for server selection.

3. The ability to report bugs through the player death cam. You can only report cheating in the current state of the game.

Please don't guve this company your money. They don't deserve it.

I do like the concept of a battle royale game, but I'm sure another company will do a much better job. This is what happens when you only care about money instead of improving your product. I have no idea how they can call this a proper launch, it's like the game never left early access.

I've been enjoying playing this game since the beta came out and it's nearly 1 year but the game still has the same issues. The major one is the number of servers and their maintainance, the servers of this game are very poor and are not present in most parts of the world due to which we've to play in far away servers which results in high ping issues, and the cherry on the top are the cheaters. After all the circumstances given when you finally start to like this game the devs will bless you with an update which will completely fuck up the game so bad that it becomes unplayable. For instance, the latest UPDATE #22 on the live servers introduced rank system and region lock, not to mention more bugs. Rank system is fine with me but region lock is a curse on the fair players who are living in Asia region beacause CHINA is the homeland of cheaters and unfortunately it lies in asia and due to region lock they(cheaters) end up playing in SEA and AS servers and in almost every single fucking game skilled players die to those cheaters. They claim to have improved the anti-cheat system but unfortunately it isn't enough and i don't think that it's gonna be any better.
Honestly, in my opinion this is the best BR game out there(ya, even better than Fortnite), it just need better developers.

IDEAS:
1. Add a shooting range or some type of private server where we can practice aiming, recoil control, etc.
2. More variety of weapons including better pistols such as desert eagle 
3. Make smaller maps where the blue does more damage so players stop camping outside until last minute.

H1Z1 had the upside of having abugged but therefore very interesting shooting system. DaybreakGames ""fixed"" it though, and erased the old proper map. So we basically got no H1Z1. PUBG is plagued by horrid spaws for loot, only Sanhok god good spawns and better cover. But EVERY map should have had those elements implemented better so we aren't getting anywhere here.

The first and second map though, how about those? The first map is in practicality better to play, but inconsistent loot spawns and cover butcher it often.

And the PERFORMANCE of the game + mechanics? The framerate is a joke. H1Z1 at least enabled the community-render-distance hack into a feature of their game. By that angle, daybreak has really tried the hardest to make a good BR game and they deserve that credit. But at the same time, they got insanely overpowered grenades. And has ruined their original game. So nobody cares about H1, fair. But that game's performance is outclassed only by CS:GO here. PUBG? It is a cringy disaster, 60 fps with a mid-range GPU at 1080p in 2016-17-18 is so embarrasing i cannot see this game going anywhere long-term unless the developers realize what design-mistakes they are actively enabling with the entire map being rendered in at all times. I am not joking. That is a fact, a reality. Your GPU and primary CPU core is being hammered so hard it is unbelievable.

The game mechanics are on their own sluggish to an amazing degree, but at least they aren't changed. So while bad, we can work with them. Ping? General mobility? I would love it all to be 30% faster, that would make the game perfect. But we can dream.

My last word will be on the Esports side of this game. I cannot see this game going far, and i believe that my original review of this game was removed for such reasons or whoever-knows-what. But why i can't see the game going far, is basically because of the framerate. The unhealtyh addiction to RNG randomizing what guns you get. And the game-style being basically mentally challenging. In CS:GO, Melee, LoL, Dota2, even competitive WoW and the list goes on, it is easy to pick a winner. With the BR genre? Crowning the winner is the most un-fun thing i have seen in my entire life!

In Melee, it is a thrill! CS:GO? It can sure be quite the ride, same with the rest of the Esport games i listed that i have dabbled into. But Pubg? Holy damn no thanks people, play this strictly as a casual game if you do not want to strain your own sanity. At this point, Realm Royale is a far more intriguing product VS any other BR game i have seen so far. That game solves cover-issues, spawns, game-fights, mechanics, and more. The only thing Realm Royale is missing is a good framerate, at least that is my take on it so far. Who knows, maybe yet another dev team will trip and fall over themselves because they do not understand what competitive natures demand? Time will tell. And time is running shorter for PUBG in my critical eyes.",1532052543,1532052543,False,5,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Putting loot boxes that require the purchase of keys to open is slimy, especially when the game is in sore need of refinement to its core systems and mechanics. Then putting in an ""Event Pass"" was double slimy, considering the state of the game and the desperation of the community for a real progression system. So they gave us a progression system, and told us to pay $10 per month for it. No thanks.

They've released two new maps. One of which, Miramar, is terrible and amplifies the problems of the game's core gameplay loop, like the uneventful mid-game, the reliance on RNG loot/vehicle placement and emphasis on running from circle to circle.

The shooting mechanics still feel clunky and unreliable. Some of this is by design, as they tried to make the guns feel ""realistic"", but it just feels frustrating when you haven't had the experience to master the weapon mechanics and you're not sure why your shots aren't landing.

Cheaters still run rampant.

FPS still spikes. Early game lag is still very real.

Ever since the early access the game in its server performance has gotten nowhere, the Desync issues are still SOOOOOO bad that you can be killed more then a players length away for a corner and this is all due to the games peer to server rather then server to peer connection style. Players with the highest pings still get the advantage in the game and this is something that THEY CANNOT GET AWAY FROM strickly because of of how the servers connections work. The other problem with this game is they tend to have MASSIVE AND I MEAN MASSIVE  game breaking bugs after a large update which basically kills any chance of the game working or being in the remote playable ( most fixes you have to make a page file suggesting this game has memory leak issues ). Then theres the other issue that all they care about is making money as fast as they can because they know this game will fail when the other battle royals come out as long as they are better which isnt hard considering this game doesnt set the bar high at all. 

If I were to suggest anything to new people buying the game it would be to STOP AND WAIT! There are other battle royal games coming out from major AAA publishers that will most likely be better and if you cant wait that long for the AAA games then wait for Islands of Nyne because theres no way in hell it could be as bad as this game. Its not to say this game cant have its fun moments but they're to far and few between that you will find yourself to frustrated. 

If i was to make any recommendation for the devs of this game it would be this. PUT BETTER LAG COMPENSATION IN THE DAMN GAME AND STOP PUSHING YOUR SHITTY MICROTRANSACTION BS ON US. The people have spoken and your stupid event pass is just awful and nothing more then an insult to the player base that have been with the game since day one. Work on making this game better buy making maps and listening to what the people want. BTW if the majority of your models are bought assets it shouldnt take you nearly HALF A YEAR TO MAKE A MAP.

First off the game does not just crash BUT IT LITERALLY FREEZES MY COMPUTER (Mind you I have a high end rig) thus needing to hard reset the pc. The game will work on occasion but then a whole slew of other problems occur.

Secondly ever since the beta ended the games optimization has been terrible. Its like it went backwards from a Beta to an Alpha. Framedrops everywhere (even on lower settings) every player is lagging to hell. I can't even land shots due to server instability. 

Thirdly.. The Cheaters... are..... EVERYWHERE... it seems that since 1.0 the cheating (ya know. The ones Bluehold was saying they would fix?) has only gotten worse. There are times where I can't even survive the first 5 minutes because some cheater who has like 5 accuracy scopes on his gun at the same time, no recoil and a sentry turret like aim managed to pick me off form the other side of the map. This is very annoying. but guess what? THATS NOT EVEN THE WORST PART!!!

Lastly (the worst part). The complete lack of support from Bluehole. I have sent COUNTLESS error reports cheating reports ect to Bluehole.....      AND GUESS WHAT!!! UTTER LACK OF SUPPORT OR FIXING.. Every time I look at the update log do I see ""Fixed Bug that caused computers to LITERALLY FREEZE!!!""? NO I DO NOT!!!. All I see is Added this. Added that Added new Gun Added new shirt but I never see a single Bug fix.

Final Verdict. Do I recommend this game? NOT ANYMORE. PUBG used to be a very fun and great game but Bluehole just HAD to throw it all away for greed.

It had its moments, when it first started out it was decent, then the cheaters showed up, and now that they are finally dealing with the cheaters, they have managed to destroy the base game. 

Let me put it this way, the game company that sued epic for ""copying"" them, made the battle pass, on Fortnite, I was okay with that, I dont play the game much because I like pubg more, but their battle pass was understandable, its a free game. PUBG released a battle pass for a paid, 40 dollar game, and even with all the negative feedback they are getting, they havent done anythhing other than to clarify exactley how you can get those skins. 

My point being, bluehole is using a free to play game model where microtransactions are all over the place and every action aside from simply playing the game costs money. Again, if this was a free to play game, it would make sense, the devs need to make money off of a game somehow, but its not a free to play game, thats the issue, they took a good concept, and then decided that instead of optamizing, fixing glitches, and improving gameplay, they wanted more money. So they went and decided to add skins, and more skins, and more skins, and then one content update that added a map.

And you may ask, ""why are you so angry about this, the skins are optional and giive no advantage"", well to put it simply, im agaionst the principle of it. I dont care either way when im in the game, ill play the game with friends and ill have fun, I wont care what i look like. But they are throwing this game to the dogs simply because they got a taste of success and decided they wanted even more.

However the recent push by the developer to make more avenues for revenue after the consumer buys the game is appaling. I don't care for skins and i don't mind there in the game as they have little to no affect on gameplay or overall enjoyement whilst also continuing to support the developement team. 

But as of writing this review the dev team have implemented a progression system similiar to their main compeditor Fortnight however this progression system, which is the onlt progression sytem in the game, is locked behind a pay wall. A free to play game like Fortnight can get away with this BUT a $30usd title has no excuse for putting content such as a progression system behind a pay wall.

I have i5 4670K processor, GTX 1060 6GB, 16 GB of RAM and game is installed on SSD.
Wit most settings on low, textures on medium and view distance on high, my FPS rate is between 40-120. I also get frequent random crashes, because fuck me right?
How the fu*k is that possible? Oh I know, because your game code is literally shit put together with tape.

Your servers are laggy, even though players are leaving, so it's problably not just the servers but also your netcode...
Everytime I meet other player I get a slight lag that puts me into disadvantage, unless the other player gets the lag too...

It's about a year since the release, you could say that the 1.0 versio ncame out only 6 months ago, but naaah, that's a lie ... because nothing has changed since the Early Access, the game is stil shit under the hood ... but wait one thing changed ... SKINS AND CASES Ladies and Gentlemen! You started sucking money from people for this piece of shit even more.

And the latest Sanhok patch? DLC?!!! For a month??? For 10€?! 
What am I supposed to pay for?! For barely working game with performance issues? I already gave you 30€!!!
Btw, didn't you guys mention on one of your conferences or whatever that you will never do paid downloadable content? Ou, touché, let's milk the cow while it lives right? Because this way, with this steering, the game is just as good as dead.

So you know what? This review will stay negative, until you guys fix your shit ... and how dare you to charge me extra for anything?

The concept of a BR is fun on its own, and the semi-realistic gameplay/gunplay inspired by the likes of ARMA make a good mix. But the reasons why I'm telling you to not buy this game are so, so numerous.

Firstly, the performance of the game is absolute garbage, without a doubt. Even people with top-of-the-line systems struggle to maintain a stable framerate, sometimes even struggling to hit 60 FPS! The main excuse I've seen used was ""but Bluehole doesn't have experience with Unreal Engine, they need time to learn!"" but this is a load of crap. You know why? Because Bluehole is also the developer of the MMO Tera, that's also made on the Unreal Engine and hase been out there for 8 years. If 8 years aren't enough for a studio to learn an engine they are beyond hopeless.

One of the main sources of bad performance is that PUBG relies in most part on store-bought assets that are almost completely untouched and unoptimized to the game's needs. The most egregious example is the ""Mylta Power Plant"" which is sold on the Unreal store as ""a complete level"" and not as an object to be put in a bigger environment. The programming incompetence does not stop there, there have been quite a few instances where Bluehole's solution to solve a problem was to completely disable a feature/option, such as things you could edit in the config files. For those with weaker systems it meant that the game only ran worse and worse as time went by instead of seeing better performance. I still cannot understand why we aren't allowed to use a custom resolution, or why we can't disable reflections anymore. Just to understand how bad the situation is, PUBG on its lowest settings runs WORSE than GTA5 on medium settings and higher resolution. And I can tell you for sure that PUBG is not a looker of a game either.

Another issue I have with the game is its main designer, Brendan Greene aka PlayerUnknown. The man's responsible for the Battle Royale mods for ARMA 2 and 3, as well for the BR mode in H1Z1, so props to him for his accomplishments. The problem is that the man is also stubborn as fuck, especially with one of the most disliked features of this game: the red zone. For who is unfamiliar, the Red Zone is a randomly appearing circle on the map that is subjected to artillery fire that kills anyone caught in the blasts. The stated purpose of this Red Zone is to encourage players to find cover, which unfortunately has the result of turning parts of the game in a campfest. To make matters worse, the artillery fire doesn't guarantee death, there are plenty situations of players that just walked through it without being hurt. Therefore dying to the zone is a dice roll since there's no skill involved in the whole mechanic. And yet PU insists that those who die to it are just ""bad players"", ignoring the fact that all official tournaments have removed the red zone. You make your own judgement of all this.

But by far the most worrying thing is the attitude of the developers themselves. Back in the early days of Early Access it was promised that the game will not have lootboxes but unfortunately this promise was quickly broken. The first lootbox was ""a test for our future shop"", but until the game came out of EA two or three more crates were released to the public. And to make matters worse as time passed more and more crates were launched that needed a $2.5 key to unlock. Seriously? I would not have complained if the game was F2P or dirt-cheap and with an extremely long support life like CSGO, but a game that costs $30 should not have this kind of crap.

People will say ""but the crates contain only cosmetics"", but this is wrong for the most part. Weapon skins are indeed not affecting gameplay, but they started being released only a couple of months ago. For the most time the purchaseable cosmetics were clothes only, and in a game where visibility is extremely important, clothes DO have a gameplay effect. Finding the lowest profile clothing with the color that blended the best with the environment can certainly give you the edge over clothes with bright colours.

I used to be optimistic about how the game would turn out back in its early days. Updates would come out at reasonable pace and initially performance issues were getting ironed out. But after the 1.0 launch, all this came to a standstill and now I have no hope that things will improve in any significant way. Bluehole keeps pumping lootboxes and more recently event passes [which has the performance of being LESS value for money than Fortnite's, a F2P game!] in order to milk the people who still have any hope in this game. They won't get my money anymore and I hope you will follow suite. It's a shame because as of writing this PUBG is still the only BR game that doesn't rely on bloom but on spray patterns instead for its weapons.",1529592857,1529592857,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Yes I have more than 500 hours on this nerves ripping game but I don't personaly recommend it. You rage et every lag you have if you have slower PC. I got it on very low settings running it like 95 FPS but its freezing in situations with more efects.(In the end I mention my PC configuration, and yea I know its unreal engine its harder to run it properly).

-De-sync yes its very often in games but in this game I feel it extremly.
-In general optimalization in this game is very bad. 
-Vehicles are terrible they bug on every mound, bug if you crash in each other and others craps ...
-Hackers yes and very often its getting better but its still not good and community in general is bad.
-Maps are big but I like it someone hates it this is fine(Sometimes you need to run very long distance thats painfull without the car)
-Sounds are in some situations nicely done but like running in house 3 floors apart of your enemy and you and you hear him is very bad and stressful.
-Non-recognition or like not admiting hits this was problem in CS:GO once and it happens again in this game, you could saw it on Shroud stream or anywhere else, Shroud hit a guy to head like 3 times on stream but in the replay he hits him once and not in the head.
-I think thats all if I forgot something please mention it in comments.
-In my opinion if Bluehole Studio was doing something to optimalizate the game and care about the community the PUBG would be better place, playable and it would be fun.

-Graphics: Asus GeForce GTX 960 Turbo 2GB
-Processor: Intel core I5 4690K 3,9GHz in Turbo
-RAM: 8GB Crucial DDR3

After playing this game for many hours since its release I can honestly say there are more negatives than positives to this game. To start, the game mechanics have been broken and not improved on almost EVER. The vehicle mechanics are horrible, nothing worse on this game than being fully geared moving through a field on a bike just to have it tip forward and kill both the driver and passenger. Wait times have gone up lately when joining games, and sometimes you cannot even launch the game because ""Servers are too busy"". There are some good features of this game, playing with friends is enjoyable for about 3 games, then you just want to uninstall and refund. Many custom modes like Zombies, War etc are not able to be played unless you get lucky when a lobby is not full, but even once it is full, good luck joining it as it never starts. Overall the game is something you may have fun with once you start, but do not expect to be putting a thousand hours into this as playing it for more than an hour a day will result in some broken screens.

But in considering how long it was in early access just shows how unfinished this game is from things like d-sync to the game crashing, fps lagg when in an intense gunfight and also when driving to get out of the blue zone the car or vehicle just randomly either blows up or flips
This game is still not finished or playable at a gameplay standpoint its just really disappointing as its been out for almost 2 years or 2 + years idk but the point is 

What the devs thought was good 
-New Crates etc
-New maps
-New Guns (like 5 new guns, scopes and Attachments were added)

What the Devs should have focused on 
-D-sync
-Fps lagg
-Region lock so it would keep the hackers out 
-Optimize the game better

All in all ive spent about 100+ hours on this game and its just so repetitive.

Another  issue are the foot steps they are way too loud and simply because of this the game just turns to, land somewhere, hope you are in the circle, find some loot, go into building with loot, close all doors and wait. You will hear any enemy within like 50 meters and then youre done you kill them all simply because you can expect the enemy when they have no clue you are there.

However, the game has outlived its phase of success and in my opinion it's past its expiration date already thus deserves a similar fate of being forgotten as DayZ. The reason for this is the Devs of the game Bluehole. At first I gave them a chance for a year, they were new to success and I hoped they would be able to improve the gameplay and actually make the game better. Instead they rushed the game out of Early Access, added a bunch of stuff the game never needed and spent more time adding cosmetics to get rich off their players that already spent a lot on their game in the first place instead of fixing bugs and successfully fighting off cheaters.

So in the meantime I tried other Battle Royale games such as H1Z1 and Fortnite and came to the conclusion that PUBG is a really bad clone to H1Z1 with H1Z1 having much more action, fewer camping and being more skill heavy in general and Fortnite being the game that just puts the action packed gameplay to a new level with the Building mechanism. While graphics of both games are entirely different, both of them have much more enjoyable and rewarding gameplay than the camp forever pubg style. The devs did nothing to ever address that and I cannot support the game any longer due to this.
If you want a realistic good shooter experience buy Arma 3. If you want a more ""realistic"" battle royale experience get H1Z1. If you want a skill based action battle royale get Fortnite for free. But do not waste your money on this cheater infested game and support these horrible devs.

(While the lawsuite Bluehole filed against Fortnite was the initial spark for me to bother even writing a review on this game, this review is not influenced by it and I litterally hated the devs for how they acted with the game from day 1 and this action just consolidated my mind that I will never play pubg again. Bluehole does not care about the players only the money, and they do not listen to us either, so fuck them)

The dev team is a mess and unable to communicate easily within their departments. The game has not delivered on what was promised. There's no mod support, there are no custom servers, there are no custom maps. There is no way to practice anything other than either the loot simulator or fist fighting if you drop in hot zones. 
 The devs are ruining the competitive community with their lack of knowledge of proper game mechanics, and failure to deliver on the bost basic essentials required for a competitive game.  

The game is still ugly and unoptimized, and can barely run on the top end graphics card. Do not buy this unless you have a top of the line cpu, graphics card, memory, and even a top m.2 drive. If you don't have top of the line ram you lose most of your performance, and if you don't have an m.2 many game items/buildings will not load in properly and ruin your game.

Even the anti-cheat is terrible, not banning who it should, and banning people it shouldn't. A game filled with people aimbotting and flying and they are still wasting time banning people for using povohat's mouse accel.  If the third party leaderboards didn't automatically hide cheaters, then the leaderboards would reveal the severity of the problem.

It's a great idea for a game, but another developer needs to swoop in and release a proper version. Maybe the chinese version by tencent can come to america.

I've been playing for well over a year, only not as frequently lately, and it is because of my last few months of experience with this game that I can no longer recommend it to people.

This game started off great. There was so much promise in its concept and execution. You could almost feel what the game should eventually be even waaaay back in its early state, back when it was so broken that a stun grenade in a busy portion of the map like School would spell disaster for several teams by promptly crashing their games with no capability to return to the match. And yet, even with absolutely infuriating scenarios like that, I am finding myself looking more fondly upon those memories than I do towards the game in its current state. And it's not from lack of improvement. Such game breaking bugs like that have been removed, and the core gameplay is leaps and bounds more smooth, intuitive, and reliable. However, there are still massive faults.

I am an average player. I have won many, many chickens between solo, duos, 2-man, 3-man, and full squad. But I died/lost 4/5 games I played, a figure which has increased dramatically as of late. I haven't won a game in weeks, nay, quite possibly over a month. And it hasn't been from lack of trying, and certainly not from good teammates. Is it balance changes? It can't be. SMG's, DMR's, and the AK currently reign supreme, my favorite and most used weapons in the game. They shoot better, tighter, and more naturally. Aiming feels great. The new attachments and scopes are great. All of the map changes are great. Every improvement they have made has been great.

So what is it? What is my problem with this game?

As of 6 months ago, this game was a cesspool of Chinese cheaters, leaving most matches in a state of absolute chaos and dismay as you get to the final several people alive only to be instantly headshotted by some cuck with an aimbot that couldn't possibly have had a bead on you from 150m out with an (at the time) incredibly underpowered Vector. And while the volume of this has subsided, it still ♥♥♥♥ing happens. What's worse is that it is no longer just foreign influence to blame. There are plenty of English speaking cheaters as well. And what makes matters worse is that the death cam and spectator views in the game are so broken that in many instances it's hard to tell if someone isn't cheating because more often than not, the perspective you end up seeing shows wild shots into the distance, inhuman camera snaps, and impossibly compensated recoil that leave you itching to hit that report button. Are people really this good? Was 6 months all it took for people to get really, really good at this game even after it had already sold 20+ million copies? I often tend to think not, and as such, any and all suspicious deaths now get a gracious report regardless of what I see in the death cam. And honestly, that's not ♥♥♥♥ing cool.

But to blame cheaters for all of this games shortcomings isn't fair, because that isn't every game. Sometimes you do just get outplayed or royally screwed by RNG or core gameplay mechanics. And I think that's where the true fault is in this game. Now that a lot of bugs have been removed and the core gameplay has been overall tightened, it's beginning to show that the base game is just...not that good. Yes, weapons are balanced, movement and interaction are much better than they used to be (though sometimes still infuriatingly clunky and unresponsive at the beginning of the game), but to call the game itself balanced is rubbish. Either you get lucky and nobody drops near you, giving you a chance to actually find gear, or you don't and you die instantly, leaving your team at a disadvantage and more often than not resulting in an immediate return to the lobby as no single member of the party wants to spectate for the next 20 minutes. This simple aspect of the game is both rewarding when you make it through, and anger inducing when you don't, cursing RNGesus to hell as you slam your left mouse button with so much hatred over that ""Exit to Lobby"" UI element.

But that is only one source of frustration. The other is how the game handles characters being behind cover. This is I think the most important complaint any player could make about this game. I have in the several hundred gigs of replays and game captures so many instances of deaths where I am shot by someone hiding behind a tree or rock or building, where only the teeniest, tiniest part of their head is exposed from the cover, yet somehow according to the game mechanics, their gun is also able to fire around that cover and complete a shot. Yet it seems when I try to do this same action, I feel completely exposed. No matter how much I lean into and creep around a corner, it's as though my entire body is exposed, and I am more often than not targeted and shot within milliseconds of bringing my gun up to aim and tapping the peek controls. For a game that while obviously isn't rooted purely in realism but still tries its hardest to bring a sense of reality into player interaction, instances like this absolutely confuse me.

Another current aggrivation includes hit detection and the application of armor values. I played a game a couple nights ago where a player in a ghillie suit was creeping his way into the circle while my squadmates and I began popping shots at him. I hit him 3 solid times with a Mini 14 from ~ 150m out. Blood on each shot, absolutely unmistakable hits right to center mass. Another teammate scored another 2 shots on him with a SCAR-L, and another teammate with an SKS delivered the killing blow with 2 well placed headshots. Upon making my way over to him, I noticed something incredibly strange. His body contained a fresh, untouched and undamaged level 3 helmet, as well as a level 3 vest that still had a whopping 173 armor value left on it. We even compared game replay footage afterwards to confirm our blood splatters, all of which according to our games showed a total of 7 confirmed hits with fully outfitted, high damage weapons. How is this possible? What about the headshots that killed him, that actually confirmed in the kill feed that he was killed with a HEADSHOT? How does this translate to no damage being taken to the level 3 helmet?

This is not the first instance of this I have seen either. Since the latest balance changes, body armor appears to have become...broken. At times, you'll feel as though your level 3 vest does absolutely nothing when you get hit in the chest from 300m away with an M24 and your vest is destroyed in a single hit. And yet other times you'll find yourself hitting someone repeatedly with a similar sniper/DMR, only to see that shiny glint of a green level 1 helmet or the washed out blue of the level 1 police vest still intact and on their body.

I'd like to believe I'm just crazy. I'd like to believe I just suck. But then I play a game or two where things just work out and I wipe a team, maybe even two by myself. And while I would love for those moments to redeem this game, to make me go ""Wow that was so worth the pain and anguish of the last 11 games filled with absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"", it isn't. Not anymore. Because even those games were you find yourself wiping squad after squad, you still get to the final couple circles only to be met with a fate that often feels engineered to put you at odds with someone who just happened to get lucky in one way or another. It is this inconsistency that makes this game feel like a waste of time.

Winning is no longer a reward of skill, it's a byproduct of luck and inconsistent game mechanics. More often than not, you'll find yourself feeling like you've simply wasted your time playing this.

Up until the moment Butthole decided to fuck me in the ass.

Dear developers, do you really think that your customers are that DUMB not to notice how greedy, scummy, absolutely disgusting, filthy and grabby cunts you are? I paid for the game. I bought your stupid crates. I was hoping the entire time maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel, maybe they went back and decided to once again be pro-consumer, to try and actually be cool in the events of Fortnite taking off like a SpaceX rocket.

Nah, man. You know, what they did? They made their lootbox system even WORSE. Lootboxes, crates with a lock on them so you need a key to open is scummy enough, but in the end you don't need the cosmetics to play the game. Sure, it's nice to look cool and all, but trickling down the items like sweat off of PLAYERUNKNOWN'S ballsack when he is counting the revenue from the market is filthy and revolting. AND to make matters worse, you introduce a fucking BATTLE PASS that is so absolutely unfair, grabby and disgustingly low in content for how much you have to pay IN ADDITION to what you paid for the game makes me want to puke.

Dear Butthole. Your game still brings me joy sometimes. I wish I could play it more often, I really do. But how you are treating your loyal, long-time playerbase, how you greedily reach out your shrivelled hands for more money - this I will never forget and I hope you eventually lose in the BR race so you get down off of your high horse and start treating us once again as customers rather than cattle.

I think the biggest issue with the game, outside of hackers, is that the map and circles are just too big for 90~ players. I have come top 5 in games where I have seen a total of maybe one other person. Unless you jump into an area that is going to be absolutely filled with players, you're probably only going to see 2, maybe 3 people the entire game. I'm sure that some people actually enjoy that, the constant tension of ""When is the next guy gonna pop up and try to kill me"" but for me the game just devolves into ""Jump into area, loot, look at circle, run towards circle, loot on the way, run towards circle, stand around"", rinse repeat until you either die or win. Eventually the circle will close tight enough that you are forced into an encounter, generally 20-30 minutes into a game, and you'll see a person and either kill them or die. 


I suppose what I'm trying to say is that the biggest problem with this game is that it's just boring. The map is big enough that it doesn't force confrontation between players. Hiding is a legitimate and highly effective strategy. Good loot is common enough that you're not required to run into high player density areas to be kitted.

This game is anything but revolutionary and great, battle royal is nothing but a deathmatch on a shrinking map, yet everyone treats it like they never played online video game ever before, go play any old video game with a multiplayer mode, choose deathmatch and there you have it. Battle royal before it was a thing, long before these scumbags creators of this garbage wanted to claim the genre as their own and tried to sue Epic Games for making battle royal game, which is ironic considering the fact they literally use their engine to run this **** game. 

The only reason why this game is relevant are streamers paid by creators, without them this game would be long dead less than a month after it's realese. 

But enough about creators, let's talk about lackluster game shall we? 
We have ourselfs deathma-battle royal in the ARMA environment and horrible recoil, we get some cosmetics here and there, it's revolutionary right? Let's just pretend there have never been any games with cosmetics in them... 
Camping, camping, camping... 
Don't you ever dare to even aim at streamer it will get's you banned from server instantly!

No skills, no skins, no cute achivements or rewards, nothing. 

Broken mechanics. Broken game still after release, after patches, they care more about making this unbalance piece of garbage into an e-sport to get even more free money for a cashgrab crappy mod with decent graphics, than fixing basic issues or making the game more enjoyable or making new mods for people that aren't on acid playing fast to run to the circle constantly with no seconds to spare. 

Fuck off.


Years later, nothing good changed. No ranking, you're mostly playing against the people who farm PUBG daily since alpha. If you alt tab before the game, you still get bugged, can't move or look sideways, fix that shit instead of making loot boxes with garbage in them. And give players better REWARDS for actually winning or doing kills. Your coins are as useless as your innovative spirit and your creativity.

What specifically affects me is the banning of VMWare.  I run VMware because I paid for it to run virtual machines so I don’t have to dual boot or run another computer. Many tens or hundreds of thousands of people that are IT professionals or just hobbyists run VMWare and I bet many of them attempt to play this game as well. Apparently this company is now dictating what legitimate software you are able to run on your computer while playing this game. I am not shutting down my programs to play this game.  I have the resources to run everything. 

So what is next? Are they going to demand you install Battleye on your router and every PC on your home network? This game was promising 6 months ago but has turned to absolute rubbish and I do not expect a turn around.

That being said, the game is still heavily flawed, and in the biased opinion of a player, the developers appear to be focusing more on adding new cosmetics, granting them more money, than on fixing the plethera of bugs and glitches present in the game. Especially the latest update truly shows that off, with the game having been rendered completely unplayable, crashing my PC whenever I start it. After doing virtually everything within my grasp, such as updating drivers, verifying the game files, and even outright reinstalling the game, nothing worked. Even before the update I could barely achieve a consistent framerate with my admittedly mediocre at best PC, a further piece of evidence that the game still needs to be optimised heavily, and is absolutely not esports ready.

As we approach a new year, a fresh trend enters the established medium of gaming -- [i]Battle Royale[/i]. PUBG is the catalyst for this uproar, being responsible for spawning even newer titles (or changes) such as Fortnite, Rules of Survival, and the H1Z1 controversy. 

[h1] [ + ] The Pros [/h1][list]
[*][i]Vehicles[/i]: Out of all the battle royale games that have been released thus far, this has the widest variety of vehicles to choose from, all with their own upsides and downsides. Granted, control whilst driving can be a chore (or unfair sometimes), but otherwise it's satisfying to use.

[*][i]Gunplay[/i]: Once again, PUBG has the best gun control that any battle royale game has to offer. Not only that, but I'd argue that it's gunplay is more effecient than other FPS-focused titles in the industry. 

[*][i]Replayability[/i]: This game can be out-right addicting, and it never seems to disappoint me every round I play (with some exceptions). With friends, it's only more enjoyable. So, if you're searching for long-term investments for any particular game, this is a must-have in your wishlist.
[/list]
[h1] [ - ] The Cons [/h1][list]
[*][i]Hackers[/i]: Although, I do believe that players have exaggerated this issue, it still maintains its relevance in the general experience. Throughout the pros, I mentioned that [b]most[/b] of the rounds I encountered were enjoyable and engaging. Suffice to say, the exceptions to that consistency is this particular issue.

[*][i]Variety[/i]: If this game was still in Early Access, I wouldn't have pointed this out. However, PUBG recently released a full release, with a major update, that enhances its graphics and optimization. On one hand, the optimization issue that was profound in the previous version is adjusted. On the other hand, the variety in maps and weaponry still feel somewhat lacking. For a $30 game, there should be more content. That's not to say that the rest of the gameplay  doesn't make up for these glaring flaws.
[/list]
[h1] Final Verdict [/h1]
[strike]Whether you hate or enjoy the Battle Royale genre, I would recommend anyone this game. There's a lot of enjoyment that can be had with this game, especially with friends.[/strike]

Dont you have computers at your company? Do you write game with chalk on fking asphalt outside on the street? Do you even know you have TEST SERVERS so people can try game and gives you feedback? How to make games 101???

The bugs and kinks were okay at first and most of the time were funny and didn't totally ruin the game. Like most early players I was really excited to play the desert map, and I had high hopes for how the game would evolve. Unfortunatley the developers have decided to focus more on making money than on improving their game.

Here are some serious issues with the game
1. The load times are terrible, even for people with good internet.
2. Due to the fact that any person can play on any server across the world, chinese hackers run wild on North American servers slaughtering players en masse. (Region block china!)
3. Driving in the game is a fucking joke, usually my team and I will walk instead of using a bike because those things probably kill more players than the guns.
4. Not enough weapon variety, I know that they are planning on adding more guns but as of right now looting gets stale pretty quick after finding the same stuff over and over again. 
5. The crates in the game were a cool concept until you needed keys to open them even after paying with battle points. 
6. The desert map is way to awkward, the zone is always in the same place so most players drop in the same spots. If the plane flies over Pecado 20-30 people always drop there, (I know you can say the same about school on old map but the plane doesnt fly over school every single time.) The map is then basically void of any players after the first 5 min until the final few zones. 
7. The servers are extremely laggy and many times people can shoot you around corners. 
8. Many times the general look of the game is not pretty, and especially in first person characters and places look bent and disgusting.
9. The vaulting/climbing was a nice addition but is really clunky.
10. The developers don't seem to listen to the player base at all.

Region lock china, IP ban all hackers. But the problem with that is the vast majority of their players are Chinese, and if they send the Chinese hackers to Chinese servers it will effect the majority of their population.

Guns and attachments are a total mystery, with no way to test any of them outside of a live game which if you're lucky enough to find one would give away your position and get you killed immediately if you attempted to target practice. In that vein the beginning of the game can be an exercise in not throwing your computer as the game struggles to load under the weight of what I can only assume is a microwave powering the servers. The mad dash to pick up items as they lag into your inventory while being punch only adds to this exercise.

Secondly, in a game of 100 people with what seems like little to no way to stop cheating the game loses any chance it could have been to be fun. With 100 people in the game there is a 100% chance you will encounter a cheater and you will more often than not lose.

There is no training mode, or shooting range for new players to practice dealing with the recoil on guns or get used to the bullet physics (since none of the guns in this game are hitscan). There is also no tutorial to show new players what they need to do or what the different items actually do, making you a sitting duck while trying to read item descriptions in-game. 

There is a epidemic of cheaters and hackers as well, muddying the experience a great deal more than it already was.

1. There are plenty of bugs, the fact that they have the balls to call this a full game is absolutley insane
2. The fucking hackers are fucking running loose in this game, it used to not be as bad, but recently I've been running into them constantly, and a majority of cheaters come from China, which doesn't help considering...
3. THERE'S NO FUCKING REGION LOCK, PEOPLE FROM CHINA ARE CONSTANTLY JOINING NA AND EU SERVERS, also since the fucking lag is there fucking ping is so bad, they'll be fucking shooting you when you're already behind cover, or when they're already fucking dead because on their screen, they still fucking see you
4. To make things fucking worse, the creator of the game outright insults people complaining about Chinese players by calling them ""xenophobes"" no fucking joke it's all fucking here https://www.polygon.com/interviews/2017/12/22/16810348/pubg-1-0-release-playerunknown-interview-china
5. Not only does the creator of PUBG call his fans racist, but he also likes to cry, a lot. He cried on twitter about Dr. Disrespect threatening him, meanwhile it was an obvious joke, he cries about other devs making battle royale games. HE LITERALLY TRIED TO SUE FORTNITE FOR ALSO MAKING A BATTLE ROYALE GAME MODE LMFAO. And he also loves to cry about how he has a small dev team, if you don't like having a small team, HIRE MORE FUCKING DEVS YOU FUCKING IDIOT. Overall, Brandon Greene is a giant fucking crybaby who should not be in charge of such a large game.
6. The desert map is TOO FUCKING BIG FOR JUST 100 PLAYERS, you can literally walk for a half an hour and not see a single person in that map, believe me, it's happened to me countless times.
7. Cheaters in general, just yesterday when I was playing I ran into a squad of 6 fucking people in 3 man squads. Stream snipers runs fucking loose on this game, and the devs do nothing to stop them, however they do ban random people just for killing streamers, even though they weren't stream sniping
  Believe me, I love this game, just look how many hours I have, I have so much fun playing this game, but it's just so frustrating knowing that this game is being treated like a piece of shit.

It's been one of my favorite games recently and it has been my ""go to"". During early access there were some stability issues with the game, such as stuttering, but it was never so bad that it ruined the experience or gameplay.

My issue with the game is the developer's stance on electing NOT to hardware ban hackers, or region lock players to their own severs (I'm looking at you China).

I believe that the huge upspike in hackers is due to items from loot crates being available to be sold on the steam marketplace. If the developers would remove this feature, or at least hardware ban hackers. It would make this model of hacking for easy loot crates and in turn profit less attractive to hackers.

The frustrating part is, is that you can't win. Even if there is one hacker in a lobby of 100, you stand no chance of winning the highly coveted ""chicken dinner"". At this point, I see no point in continuing to play the game because of how common Chinese hackers are.

Of the millions of online players sometimes over half are Chinese, I love China and Im glad it got popular there but here is where the problems occur

the servers in china are very very poor and suck ass, so the Chinese demographic usually play on EU or NA servers to get better connection and I can hardly blame them. The problem with this is the EU and NA players of pubg are now put in unfair ping decided battles because of connection from the other side of the planet.

Now you may be thinking, why not build dedicated servers in China? It is there biggest audience! Or why not have ping limiters at least so Chinese are welcome to play as long as it isnt severly effecting other players?

The PUBG creator Mr.Greene who used to spend hours kicking high ping players in Arma 2 hates any of these suggestions.

To him he sees any sort of hate towards the chinese as racsist and not because of there connection. He actively denies to take action because he refuses to ""segregate the chinese"" by making optional better dedicated servers for China.

Because he thinks this racsist and not anything to do with the simple language and connection barrier he may not ever take action on this problem. Leaving more fights in a perma death game to be decided by ping and not by skill!

If you want to buy this game I think you should because it is very fun, but I think you should hold off on the purchase till there is an update to this situation as it is temporarily unfair",1516508544,1516508544,False,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Don't fucking get me started on this game, this gaming can only be described as a love/hate relationship, anybody else that disagrees has either played enough or just is a fucking angel that doesn't get enraged from the glitches to the gun play. PLAYERUNKOWN's BATTLEGROUNDS is a Battle Royale that takes place between 2 different maps, Miramar and Erangel. The start of the game (with 100 players) is revolved around a plane which goes over the entire map which then you can drop out of and land wherever you choose, a improved feature which many known battle royales lack. Once you get on the ground, you need to find loot as you do not spawn with weapons. The objective is to win the game by killing anyone who is not a friendly but as the game progresses within the first minute, a safe zone will spawn. You have a certain amount of time to move to the safe zone before a blue force field encloses onto the safe zone. As the game progresses the blue force field does more damage each time a new safe zone is made. The feature is supposed to keep players from camping the entire time and push them to a zone where they are forced to fight. 

The game has a lot of potential to be a great battle royale but as of right now it's just not good enough to be great. Let me start out with some pros and cons.
PROS______

*Good Optimization (Came a good way from being terrible)

*Some good mechanics like Vaulting

*Creates a SENSE of realism to a certain extent

*Good ANTI-CHEAT system
That's pretty much it for Pros for me, now let's get into the cons

CONS______

*Game lag (even though you can't do much to help this) - When the players drop to the ground, a solid amount of in-game lag when players drop in the beginning of the game which can vastly effect gun play EX: if it's lagging a player can pick up an gun where in the middle of the lag spike you will not be able to pick it up but by the time the lag spike is over the player will already shooting at you.

*FAMOUS hit detection or bullet sponges most of the times, you can shoot someone 6 times but they'll take it like it's nothing but they'll grab the same weapon and it will kill you twice as quicker with the same level gear, if you used the S1897 (Trench Shotgun) you know how this feels.

*RNG looting - you can't argue this, don't even try, it's absurd how you can walk in the biggest house in the area loot all of it but not find a weapon or a good weapon but the person right next to you finds a SCAR-L and is gunning you down.

*BUGS/GLITCHES, let me name of a number of them (DIED FROM FALLING while you're on the ground or taking double damage when falling, YOU DIED FROM AN EXPLOSION 50 ft away, Parachuting but getting stuck so you fall down and take a huge amount of damage)

*Red zone - RNG death while you're in it

*The Safe Zone Placement/Blue Forcefield Placement can completely alter the game in your favor or otherwise not in yours.

*Shotguns are not consistent (refer back to Hit Detection or damage)

*LOOT CRATES - Constant duplicates of clothing but not only that the points required to buy the crate goes up each time you buy one, they only implement clothing to get you excited but only leave you in disappointment

*STREAM SNIPING bans or other bans without evidence

By far the one of the biggest issues in PUBG is hit detection in my opinion

The game has a lot of potential but as of right now as I see no changes being made to fix it. If you're going to reply back, reply back with facts rather than opinions because all of this exists in the game currently. But why do I keep playing? Winning or having fun with friends is the only reason I keep playing, which excites you, which you try to do.
ALSO INSTEAD OF FIXING THE GAME THEY PREPARE FOR A CONSOLE PORT AND RELEASE?

Played a bunch of Rust before hand and CS:GO many ages ago. The concept of the game is beautiful, it has it fair share of bugs, annoying glitches and sometimes wonky gunplay but it really is quite addictive.

However on that note with the influx of player from the Chinese region onto North American servers it has ruined the experience. Language barrier prevents communication but thats not even the real problem. The chinese players coming to play on NA aren't the majority of honest players, its the cheater population. It is not even a race issue, it is a fact that cheating in regions such as China and Korea is exponentially higher because it is less frowned upon there. You have set ups in ""gaming cafe's"" where they can log onto a computer, play PUBG on a public account or one of their many and just spend their day ruining lives half way across the world. 

Game needs to be region locked or some means of cracking down on this massive influx of cheaters. It is like nothing i've ever seen before and I played Rust...

For now BP just calls us all racists because they care too much about the almighty dollar, such a shame too. They had real potential and the game was so fun it was easy to overlook some minor bugs and such, but that was only because I rarely experienced any blatant cheating.

This game (was) fun.... When you're not destroyed by aimbot and ESP hackers in EVERY. SINGLE. GAME.

This game needs a complete rework when it comes to ping and server tick rates. The client pc is the deciding factor which is why hacking is absolutely rampant and the high ping (read- region lock please?) player wins.

In the millions of dollars they have received in the success of this game, they continue to add loot boxes to pinch every penny out of the consumer before this game dies completely because of the seemingly unfixable hacker problem (unless they 100% rework how the client/server communication and detection works and fully rebuild their anti-cheat- like that will ever happen! ).

You know your game has an issue when they only rely on the player to report the hackers and ban accordingly based on the reports.

They make posts to make you try to feel good about how they ban thousands of hackers daily, and it is plain sad.
The hacks will never go away, therefore this game, unfortunately, is forever ruined.

Buy this game if you want to get rekt by hackers  in every single game you play who can aimbot iron sight shoot you in the head full auto with an AK from 400+ meters and never miss a shot.

Happy playing.

This game has a great concept and when not saturated with Cheaters has solid execution.

After the 1.0 release the CEO took a firm stance against region locking. This has caused 75% of games to end in a hacker killing you across map.

You know it's bad when everytime you see an oriental user name get a headshot or 2 in the kill feed, you instantly sigh and say ""I'm going to die to a cheater.""

I would not recommend this game to anyone, it's littered with cheaters, a VAST majority being from China. The CEO cares more about gaining $100 instead of $75 (crude example, but Region locking would hurt the wallet I'm sure a little, but wouldn't kill the game) than it's user base.

Do yourself a favor, wait until Region locking comes out, play Fortnite, H1Z1 or another Battle Royale game.

Some pros and cons are as follows:

Pros:
-Fun in solo and in squads with friends of choice (I've got a discord server with my friends and we hit it up sometimes)
-Random Generation allows for some pretty interesting games
-In game Voice Chat can be muted
-Currently 2 maps with various distinct areas and tactics youll want to follow (although randomly chosen)

Cons:
-Chinese Players are very common in North American Servers, so solo queueing in squads can be literal hell with 3 different asian languages being screamed at you.
-Inconsistent damage can make gameplay feel hollow (Land a headshot, get 3 shotted by a pistol)
-Glitches (dropping 5 feet from a parachute takes 1/3rd of your health, winchester loading glitches which typically hit mid-firefight, etc)

BIGGEST CON: Lag, even worse than inconsistent damage is having definite hits not register, and generally make gameplay very annoying.

The Verdict: I honestly do recommend this game, but I feel that people should be aware of it's flaws, and that the con list should be reduced to nothing before the game continues to monetize (*cough* *cough* loot cases for clothing items)

OC and other servers is insane, and alot of them cheat.
6. turn voicechat down or mute it because chinese people are loud and obnoxious.

Solutions
:
region lock people to there region.

allow region reports so we can report people who are in the wrong server.

get your own anti cheat for pubg and make it intrusive so that if your not cheating you dont have to worry about anything like a ban.

currently i recomend waiting to buy this until these issues are fix because this is actually a fun game.

do not buy this game as the intended feature of squaads is riddled with chineese pricks who leav eyou alone and go and do there own thing, FUCKING REGION LOCK OR BAN THE TOXIC ONES",1514892960,1544770803,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,1,True,False,False

It is a lot of fun to play with friends, solo or in a random squad, with the caveat that you will likely be playing with a lot of Chinese players, even on the NA servers. I turn voice chat off if that happens to be the case, but generally you get semi-competent teammates. The loot crates are fine and dandy, nothing to really comment on there.

Actual gameplay has come a long way however, with the current patch making the game (for my rig at least, which will be at the bottom of review) much more stable and playable. Climbing and vaulting feel crisp, and the new map makes you use those mechanics. 

I have heard that those with AMD rigs however are feeling significantly worse performance than those with Nvidia/intel set ups, so take that into account if you're going to be buying pubG. 

The game has come a long way since the alpha/beta/ early access, but there are still a lot of issues - the biggest being the community. While I do not mind playing with people from other regions, the language barrier makes it borderline unplayable if you are squadding up with randoms. This could be solved via basic command/chat wheels that will localize on the other end, but I doubt we will ever see that. 

In addition to language barriers, there are technical ones. While I have zero evidence to support this, anecdotaly it seems like the more Asian players that are in a server, the worse the network lag gets. Again, no evidence to support but it is something that again, should be kept in mind when playing. 

I'd give the game a solid 7/10, but I wouldn't recommend this title because its still not optimized very well, (though that has changed in the new patch, so meh?) and issues with servers/populations.

Unfortunately there really is a ton of cheaters. At least one (but probably more) in every game. They can be killed so you can still win but the odds are reallllllly stacked against you. Cheats range from being able to see players through walls to seeing all players on your map in real time plus auto aiming for perfect headshots with any gun when the player is in the cross hair. There may be god mode cheats too.. I don't know. I've shot guys a ton and they turn around and one shot me. But since all the players are on the other side of the world, lag is a real problem.

So far all the cheaters  I've found are players from China playing in the NA servers though I'm sure there are NA cheaters too. It's just rare to find NA players at all in the NA servers since its 90% Chinese players. So unless you speak Chinese, don't expect to join public squad games as a single and talk to anyone.  

You'd think with the 20 million players they boast, they could afford to write some code to use geo location to force players on their local servers and ban known proxies. 

Can't stop cheating 100%, but it would sure cut down on the cheaters in the non-chinese servers. Til they fix that... expect to lose 99.99999999% of the time. Its a shame because the game mechanics and graphics are nice. People used to strive for wins... now people just go for quick kills to get better stats since they know they'll be cheat-killed before the end.

They added a death cam...so you can at least see how you were killed and see if it was legit. Unfortunatley it seems the latest cheat makes the players name #unknown. So even in the death cam you can't see who the player was that killed you. Maybe the report button works still.. who knows.  You can play a full game without running into a cheater pretty often.. well at least you could but I just played 4 games in a row with cheaters... one was in my squad. I team killed him. $%*@ cheaters.

I have been playing since early release and had a lot of fun playing. There are a lot of great dynamics to the game from intense CQC to long range firefights or random vehicle shenanigans. This game offers a lot of interesting gameplay making repetitive rounds feeling unique and fun. Even the bugs where your character was prone to exploding of flipping miles into the air from driving over a blade of grass were excusable (and pretty entertaining).

Sadly as of recently when trying to play squad (which I enjoy playing most) there are way too many hackers ruining the experience of the game only to find yourself spending majority of the game looting only to be killed from a great distance by an automatic SKS with no recoil and auto locking crosshairs (as you can clearly see now thanks to kill cams). Also not to mention connection issues resulting in you or your teammates disconnecting mid game during a firefight leaving their character autorunning into danger or rubber banding through every door and corner.

Until Bluehole can fix these issues the game has become less and less enjoyable.
Hopefully these issues can be resolved and the game can provide the same experience it has provided before.

If there were just a few things different about this game, it'd be worth voting up and recommending to your friends.

But it's not.

Starting with the gameplay:
There's only a select few shooter games that utilize realistic ballstics (Arma, Battlefield, and this game are the only ones I can think of, save maybe the Sniper Elite series, but that's a debateable topic). This would be cool, if your bullets ever registered properly.
The servers run, on average, at about 17Hz. In simpler terms, that means the server ""refreshes"" 17 times every second to register changes in the game--shots, impacts, movements, items collected, etc. To put that into perspective, most FPS games run between 30-60, CS:GO (I believe) runs at 64Hz, League of Legends at 30. This isn't even going into the beginning of the match, where the high player density forces the servers to deteriorate to an 8Hz refresh rate--abysmal by any stretch of the imagination. (Battle(non)sense did a video over this showing the details of this game compared to Fortnite, which uses the same game engine and both use Amazon server hosting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwZ_NUruGTM).

All this translates to:
- Absolutely despicable ""rubberbanding"" that is at times so unbearable it's not even worth playing (http://www.ign.com/videos/2017/12/20/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-rubber-banding-is-still-the-biggest-problem-with-pubg-on-pc -- skip to about 40 seconds, but I'm sure you've seen/heard countless other examples even worse than this one)
- Shots that were so obviously direct hits not registering, being shot when completely behind cover, shooting people square in the face with a shotgun yet they live, sometimes not even taking a shred of damage (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqwhekZdBP4, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KWw8I8dp6M <-- that one is a definitive example)
- Having to click items/doors multiple times before it registers you picked the item up/opened the door, causing you to hover in one position just trying to get a garbage pistol or shotgun (that won't even register the hit) before someone comes up and jumps up and 1-shots you with their fist (logic!)

The graphics have been improved tremendously since early access. This game was notoriously unoptimized, pushing even the highest-tiered systems to their limits on low graphics. Now, you'll receive proper performance for your system (graphics wise, gameplay wise you're f****ed bud), and running it at a constant 60fps shouldn't be an issue for any mid-tier gaming rig.

The audio is perhaps not as bad as it could be, with long-range shots actually sounding long range (you'll see/hear the bullet land on you/near you before you hear the shot itself) and suppressors being semi-realistic in that they don't turn your weapon into a subsonic, noiseless death machine that can barely be heard from 15 feet away. The biggest issue lies in footsteps, because if there are people running around you, outside the building you're in, or above/below you in the same building, you will have NO IDEA where they are because the sounds are just... whack. Even using a surround sound headset will barely help.

Yet that is almost an unnoticeable issue when you consider just how atrocious the hit registration and lag issues are with this game.

I have held off in throwing stones at this game for the longest time, as I knew it was still in early access and likely had a very long way to go. We're now almost a year into development, and somehow, the gameplay has become worse. At first, you will utterly fall in love with this game, constantly clicking the play button again even though you knew that your last death was total rubbish. You will happily loot 3 cities and get all the best loot just to get in a 15-second long sniper battle and lose it all, just to dust it off and play again. But this game will slowly begin to take its toll on your patience, like dealing with a bad partner in a relationship--you'll rationalize the negatives, focus solely on the unquestionable positives, and pretend like there's nothing wrong.

Well, there's a lot wrong. In the current state of the game, it's not worth purchasing. There are a lot of much better, more satisfying games that you could spend $30 on. Maybe in a few months, when (if) they sort the game-breaking issues out and provide steady server tickrates (at a rate higher than the painful 17Hz average), then purchasing it could be worthwhile. Until then, Bluehole (PUBG Corp, whatever the hell they want to call themselves) have a long, LONG way to go still.",1514320608,1514320608,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

They don't do shit about our experience and feedback with the game, instead they want to focus on new weapons maps and other fx stuff.

Plenty of people hack and they will get banned subsequently with enough reports, but that is irrelevent since they will end up buying another copy of the game to repeat the entire process. The hackers dont hide their presence and are unafraid of the anti cheat system. Their in-game names clearly tell you they are hacking since they put no effort into creating a name and instead put random letters and numbers. They have so many copies of the game that it is completely useless to get rid of them. The developers in turn make more money off these hackers from repeated sales of copies. Honestly, its a sickening and vicious cycle that puts normal players at a huge disadvantage and offers a very a negative gameplay experience.

This game was the subject of a sickening amount of hype, and a lot of promotion from internet personalities and that's what made it as popular as it is.

Pros: 
- Believable shooting engine with near-accurate bullet drop
- Huge variation in guns, all with their own unique feel despite theoretically just being reskins 
- The new desert map is a vast improvement on the original 
- Deep player count 

Cons: 
- Greedy developers which refuse to put the game on even a 10% sale
- Twitch-dominated community 
- Unrightful bans 
- Doesn't effect me, but runs like sin on anything average or below 
- Matchmaking system is all over the base 
- Muggy, depressing colour palette on the base game map (it's literally miserable to play sometimes) 
- Fog maps should be removed altogether, most games start with 60 people by the time half the server quits 
- Gets praised as the author of Battle Royale games despite Arma mods, H1Z1 and probably others doing it even years before it

死射门：独门秘技“死亡锁定”，遇人秒锁，开抢即爆，指哪打哪，无论是头还是心脏，无论目标是在高速移动，还是在千里之外，阅后即秒，冷酷无情。

神拳寺：独门秘技“无影神拳”，无论目标身在何方，或身在何种掩体保护中，击拳即可命中，敌人只能在绝望中哀嚎，在哀嚎中被拳打成盒，人无处可寻，己无处可逃。

风行阁：独门身法“凌波微步”，百米一秒八，谜踪身法秀遍全场，子弹射速再快，永远无法触及他们的身影。

瑜伽派：独门身法“橡胶之体”，可让四肢躯干无限伸缩，杀人角度堪称刁钻至极，若幸运，也许在你倒地的一瞬间，你可以看到他们诡异且漫长的双手拿着枪对着你。

法宝门：独门秘术“地爆天星”，以咒术催动手雷变大，直至顶破苍穹，众人目睹后无一不瞠目结舌，随之引爆，其威力大过原子弹数倍不止，顷刻间全岛生灵灰飞烟灭。

黑洞门：独门秘术“万象天引”，以秘术将全岛所有人吸附到自己面前（无视距离），并将其定住屠杀之，堪称惨绝人寰、灭绝人性。

由于修仙界向来以造福修真者为道，且所有的修真者都刻守此道，顾各大门派之间从未有过门派之别，所以各路修真人士都汇集各家所长，熟练运用各门各派之秘术、秘技及身法，以至融会贯通。其中以天眼宗和死射门为首，入门门槛最低，秘术也最容易精通，顾人数最多，因此大部分修真者至少都会“天神之眼”和“死亡锁定”，而少数天赋异禀的修真者除了这两项秘术以外，还会一些其他门派的秘技。更有不出世大罗神仙所有秘术、秘技及身法全部精通，其通天彻地之能，堪称比创世之神“蓝洞”。

I will be reviewing this gem of a video game in hopes that others read before purchasing. Many fanboys will probably yell and hate this review but don't worry! I do say positive things about the game. Let's start out with a quick compliment sandwhich... What is that you ask? Well, it's where I'll say something shitty about the game followed by a good thing, and last but not least another cruddy thing.

1. RNG shouldn't play as big of a role as it does.
2. The way matchmaking works is pretty neat.
3. Why does the hit detection feel like I'm ""Rolling The Dice""?

I wouldn't consider myself to be ""Elite"" at FPS or tactical shooters... But I'm pretty dang good. I will now write a small review for those interested in how the game works/functions. 

Let's start from the very beginning:

Signing on. Sweet ""sign in"" is pretty easy and the party system works great. There were some kinks but they were resolved for the most part. Let's name our character/persona. Okay this is a one time thing that you will NEVER be able to change. I can understand that, but still... maybe for in game currency allow us to change it? Anyway, moving on to character customization... Very minimal in aspects to features. Okay, I get it... If you enjoy the FPS variant of the game (which I do), you will hardly ever see your character anyway so it's not a big deal. If you are someone who likes to customize your character then don't get your hopes up! Let's dive into the actual gameplay now.

Gameplay is very underwhelming. You load into the game on a small island with 99 other players. You get to run around for about a minute punching everything in sight. I would start by turning off the communications because every single lobby will be little kids screaming or very loud music blasting through the headset. Okay, the minute of wait time has expired and we get teleported onto a huge cargo plane. SWEET! At this point, you must have to make the most important decision in the entire game. You have two options. One, you can drop out of the plane in a deserted location in hopes to being able to fully gear up and play for the long haul (MUST FIND VEHICLE). Or two, risk it for the biscuit and drop into a town/location where you will quickly fight for your life and possibly benefit after winning. Say you are a risk-taker, which most people are. You decide to land into a huge populated town. As your buggy parachute slowly rips off your back you must take control and quickly find some sort of weapon to fight your opponents with. It's at this point in the game where ""Your Dice Roll"" must be higher than the opponents in order to get better weaponry. Don't pick up items too quickly or the game will think you are having a seizure and it will just leave the weapons/ammo on the ground. This isn't about speed right? Anyway, you manage to escape your first victim and find yourself a nice assault rifle. Let's skip ahead to a scenario that you will become very familiar with if you manage to survive the first thirty seconds of the lagfest buttfuckery. 

Hit detection/Armor. In PUBG there are two different forms of protection and three tiers for each form.

1. Lvl 1-3 Helmet
2. Lvl 1-3 Vest

I'm not sure how the hit detection works or if it's realistic. I haven't decided to spend the time reading patch notes for this game yet (Probably should). When shooting at someone with an assault rifle or any gun for that matter, it will take more bullets according to what armor said victim has on. Okay, understandable... It's logic, a higher armor takes more bullets... WE GET IT... It just seems like it adds way more to the ""RNG"" aspect of the game and makes it much more ""luck"" dependent. For instance, in multiple occasions I shot a man with an M16 four times in the chest and twice in the legs and he is still hauling ass to dive behind a rock. He sticks a needle in his arm and turns into the INCREDIBLE HULK peeks me and hits me three times with his M16 and pierces my Lvl 1. Vest and kills me after I hit him twice more. (It only takes 5 seconds to regain your health back to 75%. (If you were lucky enough to find that juicy medkit) Hmmmm. I honestly don't mind the fact that there are armor and helmets in the game, but maybe just make a single tier of them. That would be more fair I think. Better yet, maybe just having no armor or helmet would be better. Let's move on to positioning and map control.

Okay, Battle Royale! A game mode which is becoming more popular. You have a no-no zone which every so often closes in from the outer edges of the map. I actually like this feature... well, I like the idea of it. It was implemented very poorly in this game. Here is the reasoning behind my ""OPINION"". This so called, ""circle of death zone"" closes in very slowly after a certain amount of in game time which puts you in a situation. That situation is, you have to go into the ""fair play"" zone or the magical blue gas will choke you out slowly and kill you. Cool, pretty neat concept. It eliminates people from sitting behind a table upstairs in grandma's house for five hours while you look for them. GOT IT. The problem I have with it is, it doesn't do enough damage initially when you get caught in it, and it takes WAY too long in between cycles of getting smaller. I'm not sure if maybe the map is just too large or the circle isn't proportioned correctly. Anyway, back to the first thing I spoke about when you are in the giant airplane at the start. IF you ""rolled the dice"" correctly you may have hit the jackpot and landed inside of the initial circle's ""fair play"" zone. Where then you can manage to find yourself a weapon and sit in grandma's house until the circle shrinks and more dice rolls are required. If you were a poor soul who didn't land in the circle of happiness then... well... enjoy running! You will be running for a majority of the game. There is a 50/50 chance that you get sandwiched between another group running from behind you and the current guy who has been running in front of you. If you are fortunate enough to find a vehicle then you better put the pedal to the metal and get into grandma's house in the happy zone. I mean, sure... you can strategize ways to go about getting into the circle earlier on foot but it will effect the way your looting works. Either way, it's just a great concept that was implemented very poorly in my opinion.

OVERALL, this game does have some potential but at it's current state is IN MY OPINION a buggy pile of steaming hot garbage. The main things that I personally think need fixing are as follows:

-Hit Detection
-Latency
-Vehicle Movement/Player Movement
-Inventory Optimization

Things that I think are okay/decent so far:

-Lobby system
-Matchmaking
-Some of the menu options

I would rate this game a solid 3/10 maybe 4/10 on a lucky day...

Pros: Cooperative play and gameplay at times is fun and challenging and I have definitely had a laugh and some good moments with my friends playing. The game is buggy, but sometimes the bugs can make it fun.

Cons: SOMETIMES the bugs can make it fun; HoWeVeR... when you have an unfinished game that still needs a lot of work, especially taking on a challenge like bringing it to a console; you need to get base game mechanics and server stability on lockdown. Hitboxes, frame droppage, rubber banding, and just general gameplay is absolute garbage. 

Base game: When you work on making a little film/book for your game, endorse someone else to do it, don't do it yourself; you have waaaaaaaaay more things to worry about than that kind of stuff. When you create a game, I'm guessing you create it so it's geared toward players, so that they are happy. So giving what people are spending 40.00 USD on a game that barely works and crashes every two games? That's doodoocaca.

Test Server: I understand the game is in an early access still, after months, and months, but you only got about 2 and a half weeks to fix some majooooooooor issues. Game crashing, every hour sometimes less; terrible frame rate, broken hitboxes, garbage loot dispersion especially for Miramar; game freezes that lock up your entire computer allowing you to do nothing... There's more but I'm wrapping this up.

Please, fix your game. It has so much potential, but is not fixed. Do not waste your hard earned money on something that's broken and still broken. Wait until it is fixed.

***Note: I have a GTX 1070 with a solid 15 GB of onboard RAM, so its not on me

***Edit***

200 hours in and the latency issues, somewhat fixed. Starting a game is still slow but it's better I'll give them that. 

HoWeVeR... The addition of the desperado crate as one of the rewards you can unlock with BP... I understand it's a money thing sure, but for the last 4 that I have been ""rewarded"" with in a row that I'm definitely not spending my money to open just to get a sh***y long sleeve is absolutely absurd. So I will most definitely sell your crates to get $0.75 so when I get another one, I can buy it with the stupid key.

Hacking: There are a lot of hacking and cheating going on. A lot. It is ridiculous. Every other game, I get schmurdered; one-tapped, and killed. No skill there. Region lock. It's not against race or ethnicity, or any other garbage, its about fairness. The U.S. can deal with its Northern American cheaters and China get work with theirs. More stable servers, and less griefing and more cooperative play from people who speak the same language as you and don't make the pre-game lobby even more cancer, ""China number 1.""

In review: I'm still giving this a negative reccommendation even though a lot of stuff was fixed and has made the game more playable. Honestly, this should still be considered an early access review because the game just is not finished.

The gunplay is nothing too great but is serviceable, this ties in with first person mode being clunky and badly made to the point of frustration.

The graphics are quite nice on maximum settings if your pc can run it through the non-existant optimization (focus on features rather than fixing). I haven't noticed any issues with render distance and hiding in the grass which is a huge plus.

The community is toxic although with the game being number 1 on steam you are bound to get toxic people by the thousands. While I've never played H1Z1 I wouldn't know if the game is actually any good as the reviews have been tanked by people fanboying over PUBG (as an example of toxicity).

Seriously, if you get into a game with a streamer, just leave. Chances are if you interact with the streamer in any way shape or form, you'll get accused of stream-sniping and banned.

You can check that out in the replay section in game. Death cam is poorly optimized aswell as spectate mode. Hitboxes are good but vehicles have bigger hitboxes and also bigger area coverage meaning that you can die if somebody rams you with a car but you are not actually in front of it or you are about meter or two away from the vehicle in horizontal way aswell as vertical(as i already said, that is client1-server-client2 side problem). Bullet trajectory is unbalanced. Bullet speed is unbalanced. Sound latency of the gun and the bullet speed are exactly the same meaning you will hear the hit from a bullet at the same time as the sound of the gun that fired it which is unbalanced, sound speed needs to be at least 100-150% faster than the bullet. Overall sound is terribly low, so having a program that boots your sound is a must for this game. Footsteps should be heard from 45-50 meters(i have tested it myself with some friends) at the very least but due to poor sound optimization after the latest patch we all need to use sound boosting programs.

It's riddled with hackers, and they don't only come from China. They rushed the game to get their 1.0 release out before the end of the year so they could make it to some kind of Game of the Year BS, which really shows. 

Their servers are complete garbage. They lag, badly. Even after their ""server update fix"". Nothing like shooting at a player running out in the open only to lose sight of them because the server sent them 50 feet back the direction they were running from. Or my favorite - shooting at someone in a window who is peeking at you, but instead of you hitting them, they hit you even though they are no longer peeking at you and haven't been for over a full second (kill cam confirmed on a couple of these). This game is poorly optimized for sure. If you have a baller ass computer, then you will alright to play. But if you are lacking in certain hardware, you are screwed. Games shouldn't be this way, but they are.

The gun mechanics only make half sense and are something to be desired and on top of that, are completely inconsistent. 

For some reason, when prone, you can only look up so high, which does make sense. But, when you are prone with your head facing uphill, you can't look any higher off the hill than where you are laying. It's like they have the prone vertical viewing angle set at a certain degree that can't be passed no matter what. 

I would say wait to buy this game. Let the devs work out all the kinks and bring it up to the 1.0 ""release"" it SHOULD be at.

This game has potential, but needs A LOT of work.

As of right now, not recommending this game to anyone at the moment.

****UPDATED 7/21/18***

This game has turned to complete garbage. Crashes often. PUBG has spent the better part of their time worrying about e-sports BS instead of making the game acutally e-sports ready.

Hit detection is extremely hit or miss. ""Recoil reducers"" (grips, muzzle, stocks, etc) don't really reduce recoil at all, even when you are single shotting at targets. Scopes seems to be a f*cking joke in this game. They are so random when it comes to being ""accurate"" that it's commical.

Servers are probably the worst they have ever been. The rubberbanding still has not been fixed and lag seems to plague them constantly, this also contributes to the hit detection.

The game devs and PUGB Corp / Bluehole have taken super negative twist in this game and it's community. They are going to add custom matches, but at a cost? I mean, really? You are gonna have to pay to play custom games? This is a SERIOUS money grab (let's not even talk about the ""Event Pass"" or crate system) and it's a HUGE spit in the face of their player base.

Hackers are still as rampant as ever in this game and there is no end in sight to alleviating the problem as best they can. The reporting feature is nice, but you never know when someone that you reported was actually banned or punished in any way. This means you have no idea if what you saw was actually a hack, or just their glitchy ass ""kill cam"" that is always bugged in one way or another.",1514878551,1532193640,False,6,2,0.544699788093566895,0,True,False,False

Do not buy this game yet. Wait for fixes, wait for the anti cheat to start banning more people (currently bans 3 - 5k players a day apparently and its still not enough), wait for map selection, wait for FPS optimization, wait for the desync issue to be fixed, wait for some sort of region lock.

If you HAVE TO play this game right now, which you don't, buy and play it with another friend. Don't go into this game expecting to have a blast in solos because the game is about 70% luck and 30% skill, there is a TON of things you need to learn to become good but your skill hardly matters in the current state due to the insane desync and SUS AS FUCK aiming from others. I have footage of me being shot through a 'wall', dying through busted ass vehical physics and people cheating the footstep sound system to 'walk' up behind me and kill me. I would record more but now shadowplay doesn't work with pubg anymore, hmmmmmmmmmmmmm a bit strange that how I am seeing more and more sus plays and I can't record it now?

The game is a fucking complete mess for release. The rubber banding is so bad at points you may as well just stand still. In one round I managed to land on a M16 and picked off 3 - 4 people with ease as they COULDN't MOVE FROM RUBBER BANDING.

The new map is actually designed well for the new vaulting system but its such a large map you'd think it was built for 200 people. The original map is a great size for 100 people, in miramar (new map) you rarely see people even when dropping in a popular zone.

This game has so much potential, but with constant sus plays (In the past 2 days I've been killed by headshots more than any other death, 80% of my deaths come from 1 - 3 tap head shots) and horrid optimization and lag, this game needs more time. It's a horrible release. I'd recommend this game to the ends of the earth if the issues above were fixed but for now -

D O    N O T   B U Y


Update 1: Rubber banding is almost 100% gone which makes the first 5 mins A LOT easier to handle. FPS still drops hard randomly and is extremely unstable. I get anywhere between 20 - 65 FPS but to be fair about 60% of the time I have around 60 FPS, driving drops my frames making the horrid driving physics even harder to deal with.

Cheating still seems a massive issue as there are many articles online saying roughly 3m players with 1.5m accounts banned. Honestly I've been dying fairly lately (by that i mean no obvious cheats) except for a recent round with an obvious wall hacker (tracking my position the whole time through walls in the death cam). Funny how shadowplay still doesn't work so I can't record these -.- .

Still not recommending until cheating has almost been completely crushed, FPS has been solved, desync at least LOOKED AT. The only way I can recommend this to someone is if they want to have some stupid fun with friends.

Update 2: New patch came out to focus on FPS issues. FPS in the lobby sits around 60 which is awesome. In game however it drops down to 4 - 7 and sits around 27 - 35 fps while spiking up to 50 - 60 fps depending on where I am. City's have my fps dip anywhere around 5 - 35 while large open areas and smaller building spots can get 40 + fps. Sometimes the game just sits around 40 even in these areas. The 10 games I've played so far still has fucking god awful desync issues but I haven't seen many hackers (most of them play third person). Still a no from me.",1514257691,1517033239,False,6,1,0.544234097003936768,0,True,False,False

I want to love this game more than I do. 
Sadly it is poorly coded - especially the netcode - from the ground up, so it will never be polished or optimised, as they would have to start the game again from scratch. 
Game has quite a few hackers - unavoidable with popular shooters, although it may help if the hit registration of bullets wasn't client side - Duh!
The game can't make its mind up between arcady and realistic. 

Arcady - instantly swapping weapons, ammo, armour, clothes etc. Bunny hopping (so stupid, not sure if they are taking it out, but idc as I have already lost interest/stopped playing) Physics are all over the place (which can be hilarious, but not realistic). The ""down mechanic"" of players in team play - sure it helps team play.... a bit (since most of the time downed players get prioritised - leading to an outright stupid gameloop) but it is totally arcady nonsense as far as game design goes. Driving - like a go-cart on the moon.

Brutally realistic -  the shooting in terms of bullet drop, aim, damage (which is unfortunate due to the poor netcode trying to communicate all of these attempts at realism). The fall damage (which is unfortunate given the error prone and arcady physics).

I had fun with this game when it first came out (even though it was hilariously poorly optimised, actually that probably made it more fun/funny) but on the whole I can't recomend it now. There are better made battle royales out there, which have been in development for a lot less time and are free.

The proper response would have been to address player concerns by improving the game, and attempting to draw in new players (hopefully pulling them away from other Battle Royales).

Given the direction they took instead, I honestly cannot suggest buying this game. Developers who have taken similar actions have ultimately gone under, and ruined their titles.

So I can tell you with experiance that this game is not good, its a ton of fun with friends, and winning feels great, but the game is lacking big time. The servers are poorly optimized and I have friends who crash regularly while in game. The combat system is far from consistant, and you will find yourself being killed while your behind a wall, or your bullets missing targets despite having the right crosshair placement. The game is infested with chinese players who speak little to no english, other than the normal PC gaming terms, such as ""Fuck you"" or ""Fuck your mother"" So don't even try to solo que. The game is also infested with hackers, these hackers can wipe whole servers with the slightest of ease and waste what could be up to 30 minutes of your time if they wait to do so.
 The game offers two different maps, so if you don't like one of them, you will spend about half your gameplay time on a map you don't like. The game also has a rather small variety of weapons, and after a while of playing, you long for something new. The game is still very glitchy and you will find yourself sliding down hills to your death when you could clearly just walk down. You will find motorcycles flipping on the smallest of bumps, killing everyone riding it.
 The loot system in the game is mainly RNG. If you land in a big city, your odds of finding better gear go up, but you will have to fight for it and its a miracle if your whole team makes it out of those fights alive. The game has also just incorporated loot boxes that cost a major $2.50 to open. Welcome to Counter Strike 2.0.

Overall the game still needs a ton of work, and a lot more content, and until the bugs are worked out, and the combat made smoother, its just not worth the $30 price tag.

Having played over a thousand hours on Arma 2 DayZ, this game is the only real game I have played that has hit that itch left by DayZ “problematic” growth. You can sink hours and hours into this game and I have enjoyed it ever since I picked it up.

That being said, since this game has moved to full release I think its important to review it accordingly, and quiet frankly the game is nowhere near at an acceptable standard. Constant lag outs, constant issues with servers and every other issue you could imagine. The game is still plagued with issues that were acceptable while the game was in beta and alpha development, but not when it is now a full release. It still feels like a low budget even though it has sold tens of millions of copies. 

The game is great and I would still recommend anyone considering it to give it a go, however I feel that if some other AAA games were of equitable performance experience to PUBG, they would slaughtered by reviewers. The game should have stayed in Beta and not pushed a rushed full release. The game is still in an unacceptable state.

The game does not listen to its community, it implements unwanted changes for no reason and has THE WORST MATCHMAKING I have ever seen in this game.

The first game I have ever cracked 1000 hours in and I feel like the last 400 were trying to wait for a game in OCE.

If you live in Australia or NZ, wait until they fix ping-based matchmaking, it is hands down the worst implementation of a system in a game period. 6+ months of being unable to play on local servers, gets fixed for 2 weeks, but in classic BlueHole fashion the miff it up and break other servers. So what do they do? Implement another 'fix' that once again breaks the servers for OCE and apparently South America. 

To repeat, this game could be amazing, I truly do believe it still will be, but if they don't give their ENTIRE playerbase attention, not just China and NA, it will crumble more than it already has.

If you are from OCE don't buy this game in its current state.

On the one hand, it started the battle royale phenomenon and is really fun to play a lot of the time. On the other hand, it's painfully obvious that the developers place their paying customers as a low priority, there are a few ideas that support this.
1.) They do nothing about region problem. If you are a North American player, the odds of you getting a squad that speaks your same native language are very slim. This makes communication impossible, and the others you play against lag. There have been weekends in which after queuing for 12 games in a row, not one time was there another English speaking player in my squad, and about a quarter of these rounds were lost to an obvious cheater.
It is also primarily Chinese players who are a problem when it comes to spamming servers with their advertisements for cheating software in game and then leave your squad. This is solved with a region lock, something Bluehole refuses to do and has even made it seem like players are racist or malicious for noticing this.
2.) Bluehole makes sure to prioritize things like unlockable, pay-for items like crates before addressing game-breaking bugs. You can still get stuck in a large variety of places in the map in which you can not move or get out, rendering the game over for you if you enter the wrong building or part of the map.

The main reason I would not recommend this game anymore is because I feel like it supports bad change in the world to continue financially supporting companies like Bluehole.

Why? Because of all the horrible lag / network issues / performance / draw distances and pretty much every single subsystem of the game.

Network issues are present in every single game. My fps is under 75 on an 1080TI@1440p, the graphics are dated and the effects terrible

Draw distance means that sometimes you see yourself surrounded by bushes, but the enemy sees you standing in the middle of a field, granting him a free wall hack

- Money > Community
- Adding something just for the sake of removing it in the next update ( i'm talking about the map chosing system that was a + until they've added the Shanok map and made Miramar and Erangel back to the same thing they were.

- Adding lots and lots of cases that can be opened only with keys bought from the market even tho it's 30 euros game
- Everyone's asking for a matchmaking / ranking system but no one from pubg corp doesn't give a fk bout it.

IS IT WORTH PAYING 30 EUROS FOR PUBG?

Ok, let me start by stating as of writing I have 388 hours in this game. 
A sign of it's quality? No
The [b]only[/b] reason I have any hours in this game is friends.

So recently there hasn't been much in the way of good multiplayer games, with most conversations with friends being ""what game do you want to play?"" and then a long drawn out process of figuring out what game we all had and wanted to play, usually counter strike. But this game came along with battle royale and despite h1 and arma coming before it this was a first for all of us.

Those first 200-300 hours were gold, the game bugged out occasionally but the promise of the game recieving early access support in the future with constant fixes was reassuring. We all agreed this was some of the most fun we've had. And then came the esl update, adding esl related graffiti all over the map advertising this tournament for a game that was nowhere near esport ready, along with this they added lootboxes that required keys similar to csgo.

What followed was a massive storm of backlash, among that noise was me, here's what happened. I joined the pubg official discord amongst this update to see what the situation was. When I got there I saw a channel move faster than I have ever seen, speeding by with concerns and anger, among the storm a lone PlayerUnknown himself responding to the best of his abilities. Seeing my chance to contact the developer I asked a basic question asking why they are planning to run an esport event for a game that was clearly not near to leaving early access, I recieved a response from the man himself saying something along the lines of it being a trial for br events and the format needed (this being not true as games like h1 have also ran events in the past), I still said that just because they can doesn't mean they should as the game isn't stable and reliable enough for an esport environment. I wish I could provide definite quotes but after this the server got purged, I was banned and all traces of that whole channel were erased.

Since then the game has tactically exited early access early to justify selling microtransaction loot boxes and to leave the stained image of ""early access"". Since then among a few fixes related to performance a majority of updates have been new weapons, slight changes, limited time events (why make them limited time? Because the devs know if they added the new gamemodes as permanent modes then the playerbase would be spread thinner as nobody will want to play the base battle royale game, as it's just not fun), and the absolute disaster that is Miramar.

Miramar is a map so poorly designed it essentially wrote the book on how to not make a map in any game ever. We have massive wide open areas with nothing but sand, a high density of northen towns that the plane hardly reaches resulting in everyone being bottlenecked into the smattering of towns southside. The clip brushing and terraforming was done blind, I'm convinced that bluehole essentially made it a drinking game where the loser then has to go work on the map, cars constantly crash on invisible jagged hitboxes coming from the ground, mountains and holes are just sprayed over the desert with one hole being near inescapable to those who are unfortunate to step into the budget sarlacc pit.

As far as the xbox one port of the game, although not relevant to the pc version, [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdGBwrJ6rtI]this video pretty much highlights the nature of the devs.[/url]

But all this drivle aside, what is the game like? It sucks, once the banter of friends wore off the game revealed itself to be a buggy mess in the infuriating kind. Hitreg is abismal with death cam providing a completely different situation to the one you assumed you were in. Spectating is still broken after all this time with my friends jolting and jittering around. Along with this hackers have began to spread across the servers to blatant levels of aim assist, but with no stable spectate feature we can never tell without doubt.

So what can you expect in the future after purchasing this game? Luckily for you Player Unknown has mastered the art of the con, as of writing our old pal has decided to announce an event pass that will lock skins behind an additional microtransaction similar to counter strike's operations, except counter strike works as a game. But to maximise his profits he has now placed the game on sale -33% off to entice new players to spend money on this pass.

If you are desperate for the battle royale experience you should consider alternatives such as Fortnite which is a game that went through a 4 year development process to get to a playable state before launching. Or perhaps you could go old-school and boot up your old copy of minecraft and play some hunger games.

All the hours you may see incremented on that little number are from friends begging me to play, pubg was never a good game that offered an amazing experience, it was my friends. And in that spirit I will do all I can to find something, anything that could offer a fresh and fun multiplayer experience.

I hope I was able to get my opinion across in a readable manner that didn't seem too ramble-y to help inform you of your purchasing decisons. (Thanks for reading <3 )",1529532531,1529780414,False,4,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

I have 134 hours into it as of now. The concept behind this game is great. It really may be one of the ultimate team strategy games. When you are able to finish a game with your group of friends and earn the Chicken Dinner, it feels like you have really earned the win. You really feel like you overcame the competition and pulled off together. However, this is the single most problematic game I have ever played. The glitches are mind numblingly horrible. If you are lucky enough to succesfully load into a game and jump off the plane, you will most likely take fall damage from the game forcing your parachute to un-attach. It doesn't matter if your feet are touching ground or your are three feet up. Next, once you land, the game starts to load weapons on the map. It has nothing to do with how fast your pc speed is, sometimes one room's weaponry will load, while yours take an extra 15-20 seconds. This may not seem like a big deal, but it does when you've landed next to someone and they are picking up a shot gun, but the game hasn't rendered your position's weapons yet. Sometimes this works in your favor some times it doens't. It's the luck of the draw. Now, if you survive the beggining of the game, be prepared that a minimum of 25% of your games may glitch in other ways. For instance, you may 30 minutes into a game and be driving into the circle while the storm is chasing you and you car will stop on a dime for no reason while you take severe damage. Better yet, you may bump into a rock driving 10 mph and have one of two things happen: your health gets chunked by 75%  or your car flys into the air like it wasa cannon ball that was just shot into the sky. When this happens, you will die when you land. In fact just two nights ago, I was driving a motorcycle with a friend on the back. When I got off the cycle, he was stuck on it. The cycle then fell over, I couldn't get the cycle upright and he couldn't get off of it. We had to shoot him so that his character was ""downed"" then the cycle stopped glitching. Now, I would say 1/3 of your games will involve attempting to load into the game, you will hear the plane starting to fly, but your screen will still be loading. When this happens, you have to exit the game and rejoin lobby. This happens ALL THE TIME. It happens to everyone in my group (6-8) that play. Lastly, if you get through all that, don't try to play one Tuesdays or Thursdays around 8Pm Eastern. They shut the servers down for two hours for maintanence / updates. Now, normally I wouldn't care very much, however this game seems to have an update every effing week. This game came out of early access in April of 2018. What. A. Joke. This game is not complete. This game is more broken than many early access games available on Steam. I really get the feeling that the people who created the game don't appreciate their customers. Why would I say this? because their actions really point in that direction.

-cool idea
cons:
- Trying to make money off of loot boxes as if this game were the same quality as CSGO. Game was not even out of Beta before the scam tactics began. 

-No concern for the actual playerbase.

The game is a battle royal mode, you start PVP against 100 players in solo, duo, or a team and your goal is to be the last remaining. You will start out in a field with 99 people punching one another, then go to a plane full of 40 screaming asains yelling ""China #1"", 40 year old men saying racist things while eating their mic, or 12 year olds talking about forced intercource with you/your mom. Normal stuff in todays gaming chat but you can't really expect any adult conversation here like in other games.

I honestly don't suggest anyone buy this game.  In a normal game it is way easier to deal with cheaters, in this game you spend 25 minutes running around picking up loot to watch a kill cam of some guy staring at a wall suddenly shoot and kill you at distances you didn't think were posible.

The game is I guess out of Beta but still buggy and laggy as if it were in Alpha. Half the time the textures don't load before drop (SLI 1070/ or single 1070 does not matter). I play Arma II & Arma III so for the issues not to be present for me in either of those games but show up here seems odd to me. The controls are super clunky like no game I have ever played before, it feels like everything is big and blocky and aiming is mostly a game of chance.

No I don't have 300, 500, or a 1,000 hours in this game, I don't think that means those are the only people able to review this game. Just means they have spent huge amounts of wasted time imo.

My favorite story is the chinese guy in duo who drove me to the out of bounds and then tried running me over repeatedly.

BUT

There are MAJOR issues with this game that might make you relucant to buy this game. 

Hackers are plentyful on NA servers, lag discepency is rampant, and many, MANY people playing the game on NA servers, do not speak english. Not trying to sound racist or anything, but this is ALL because of Blue Hole's way of handling China's Servers: Not having dedicated servers for China to fix NA lag, and rerouting China's laggy players via a VPN which compounds even more lag. Furthermore, 95% of the hackers detected by Blue Eye Anti-Cheat System(WHICH DOESN'T STOP ANY CHEATING), are from China. Plus 9/10 players on NA servers are Chinese. This is a problem when you want to be an effective teammate, but the only fluent language you know is  english. Now given these points, the creator of the game, Brandon Green, had made it known that he will not fix any of these issues. He just won't, full stop. 

He thinks we're all being racist against the Chinese when really we just wanna play a game without aim bots, lag, or CHINA NUMBA WAAAAN. And I'm not racist, I dated a chinese chick once. I love china long time 

So yeah don't buy this game, untill all these issues are fixed, usually by way of region lock.

With the release of the 1.0 update, PUBG suddenly became overrun with hackers, high-ping players, and non-English speaking players, which, by the game creator's own admission, come mostly from China. 99% of these high-ping players and hackers are Chinese due to the ability for these players to play on the Western servers, rather than their own.

Now, these issues are very well-known amongst the community. Mentioning this to a regular player will not be news to them. Unfortunately, that is not the case with Brendan Greene, the game's creator. When he noticed the hate towards the Chinese gaming community and the obvious issues plaguing [i]his[/i] game, he instead decided to blame the dedicated players who felt that things needed to change. He claimed those criticizing the lack of changes were nothing but [i]xenophobes[/i], that their criticisms stem only for their supposed hatred of Chinese people. Of course, it would be ignorant to discard the blatant racism some players do throw the way of these Chinese players, and I'm sure some players are truly xenophobic, but pinning the blame of the game's own shortcomings on the loyal fans supporting it is not fixing anything. Who could possibly enjoy playing against those who can turn a corner and kill you before you even see them, and play with players who don't even speak your language, in a game where communication is key? Not to mention those who can cleanly headshot you from 500 meters with a pistol. It just isn't fun.

I truly hope that these issues are fixed soon, and Brendan Greene doesn't continue to be ignorant about these issues, so that we can once again enjoy playing in the [i]BATTLEGROUNDS[/i].",1516749179,1516749179,False,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

Theres a saying among my friends. Its called getting PUBG'D. Thats when you die for any reason stated above. These arent personal player issues, these are another challenge (not intended as a gameplay feature by devs) for you to overcome.

It truly is a shitty game of survival, the feeling of winning is greatly appreciated when the game mechanics itself are even out to get you. Im not holding my breath for this game anymore. After the release of 1.0 all I can see this game being is just a casual team game for LOLs and a cashcow with lootcrates for the devs.

Clones we're released and they had to step up their game due to low updates and no real progress in game development. Started dropping update content all over and surprise released the full game after the Xbox release. Now there are frame issues, lag everywhere, and a slew of more issues. On top of it all, since release day ago all the matches I've played have returned me 0 battle points. I've played a few games and probably lost over 1000 points. After a few games of this ""bug"" happening to me and all my friends, I have decided this game is going downhill and will probably be playing it much less. They drop full release when it isn't ready to compensate for other companies jumping in the ""battle royale"" spotlight with free or much less costly pricetags. Since I cannot gain any points toward progression (in this case the rewards from crates) I will not be playing this until the issue is fixed. Besides this issue the lag/frame skips/glitches/etc that are now more prevalent AFTER full release, just shows they're trying to jump the gun in order to scramble back up to first place in the BR game race. They put out the game a year ago and didn't update anything substantial until about 3-4 months ago when vaulting was supposedly going to be added a few months after the early access began. Keep in mind they did allow these feature on the test server, but this server had limited access and was at times a more stable version of pubg. After the release however, where one would assume things have been ironed out more than they were in the test server, the game is just worse. I may not have the best PC but my friends with top of the line gpus and CPUs were having almost MORE issues with lag and framerates than I was. Even after turning down the graphics that they were able to have set at all high previously, but after the ""full"" release they dropped their settings to mostly med-low and we're having the same if not more issues than I was. Sad to see this great go the route of laziness and procrastinating to the point where after competing games have been released in early access, bluehole had to try to quickly recover the market they had dominated for a few months. They got waaayyy to comfortable with their success and now have kinda let it slip through their fingers. On full release the rewards system is broken and does not reward anything, test server ran better, third person aiming is a hassle now, plus a plethora of other issue are plaguing this release and I fear nothing will be done about it as it had been handled like that in the past.

The devs have shown they care more about pumping out extra garbage content without any work towards fixing the biggest issues with the game. NA servers seem to be nearly half Asian players who cannot be killed. Every match in my last dozen hours has ended when a player with either an Asian name or a long string of numbers, without armor or helmet, freely killing everyone they come across. I'm 100% certain at this point that people claiming there isn't a cheating problem are either trolling by lying or cheaters themselves. The 30 strong clan I was in is down to three people still playing. This issue is compounded because, even while they're still in early access, they are incentivizing cheating by allowing players to sell their items on Steam. People are actually making real world profit by cheating in this game.

Even if you ignore the cheating, they are working on a test build that is supposed to go live in seven days, as of this writing, and is supposed to be the game's official launch. That build crashes multiple times per match and is far beyond broken with all of the lag and connection issues. Our group ranges from cable to gigabit fiber and we all experience the same game breaking lag spikes and disconnects.

I originally thought they must be spending all of their time on asset creation, because of the new map, then I noticed most of the assets are cheap purchases from the Unreal Engine Marketplace. How can a game make more than 100 million dollars, only spend a few thousand on assets and still not have money to address the server issues?

To be fair, I have at times had a lot of fun playing this game. But it has gotten to the point where there are too many issues to deal with, advertisements to circumvent, and too few rewards to make me glad I spent money on this game and wish to continue playing. 
I do not recommend this game to anyone unless under extreme discount or free-download. PUBG is not worth the asking price. The game seeks to coerce players for additional money and repeatedly disappoints in rewarding people for playing. While still getting updates, there is not enough being done in ways of improving the game; specifically, little to nothing is being done to improve the mechanics, physics, or interaction in the world in any notable way. For example: I have witnessed server lag consistently through mutliple matches and the Death Came still does not show accurate information. Simple features witnessed in other games that has yet to be solved here.
Instead of improving the game, they are adding more ways to spend money. They add events that you can partake in and purchase passes for, cosmetics locked behind passes, and changes to the menus with new banners for those same passes. It is saddening, frustrating, and does nothing to add to my enjoyment of the game. It feels as if it has become solely a money-grab at this point and I regret spending money on this game.
Despite all of this, ignoring these debilitating features, I do enjoy the realism that this game offers and the thrill of playing in a battle royal. Because of that I do try to play it from time to time but I have to dig every time to find enjoyment. 
I cannot and do no wish to recommend this game to anyone. I feel undervalued as a player and that I am being pushed to put more money into the game.

-random landing after parachute + getting damage in 8/10 cases (due to bad programming)
-hitting someone with melee weapons is completely random (due to bad programming)
-items spawn up to 20 seconds after landing (due to bad programming / servers)
-you can oneshot people from 100 meters with a shotgun or deal 10 hitpoints from 1 meter, mostly luck based
-completely braindead early game mechanics: Instantly find a weapon or die. Therefore you need to start about 5 rounds to get into the game or just drop at a location where nobody drops and be bored to death
-players' steps relatively quiet compared to other sounds but very important for locating enemies, so max out volume until your ears bleed or play with handicap 
-no rewards for kills exept loot and no anti camping mechanic. That means killing is fun, but wont get you any advantage. You will more likely pull attention and get ambushed from behind.
-> For winning the game, just go afk for about 30 minutes and kill the last guy.

-much less BP in Duo / Squad than in solo. WHY?

If you don't mind the game crashing at least once a session, cheating so rampant that you can expect to die to one every third game, rubberbanding and server lag like you're on dial up, and the lobby client taking full minutes to load regardless of pc specs, then the game is worth picking up.

I have a lot of hours into the game, because the base formula of the game is phenomenal. You should expect issues as above in early access games, so it was easier to swallow early access, except that most of these issues didn't even exist when I started playing. In fact, the only two of the above that actually were an issue 8 months ago was the occasional game crash (once every 6 hours or so) and slight server lag as the game started, that clears up within a minute, but overall not bad. 

As they added to the game, the client went through some of the worst bugs I've ever seen in any game, ranging from the issue that exists today (which somehow transcended between lobby clients and is somehow even worse right now!) to absurd things such as leaving your team mates in seperate queue's if changing any of the options to he queue, and the only fix to this was to reload the game entirely. That particular bug lasted FOUR months. 

The cheating, while very disheartening, should be excpected in any wildly popular game. Sadly because of the format of the game, it feels like there's at least one in every other game (and this was actually true at the height of cheating) and bluehole was admittedly unprepared for this games' success. Also the design of how pretty much everything in this game works is on client side instead of server side, making it easy for the cheaters to do absurd things like raise your gun  to literally anywhere on the map while only your physical body is vulnerable, permanent invisibility, one shot kills (even ignoring downs) with any weapon, and of course your casual speed and aim hacks. 

I have other issues with the game, but they're mostly personal so I'll be keeping them to myself. Ultimately, I will be coming back to this game periodically to see which of these issues have actually been fixed & expect this game to be worthwhile in 6-12 months, but in the meantime, I suggest saving yourself the migraine of chasing the magic dragon of legitimate gameplay for another several months, as the game is still very much ""early access"" despite the tag of official release.

-90% of your playtime, unless you die immediately, will be wandering around, wondering where everyone is, darting in and out of dozens of buildings and hundreds of rooms doing the exact same tedious looting process every game.

-Lag kicks in when you interact with other players, with the biggest spikes happening at the worst times. It plays a massive role and you can get killed around corners; the netcode favors the player who sees and shoots first. This is great after 20 minutes of looting and wandering around.

-The crate system is BY FAR the stingiest I've ever seen. It's insane and laughable, with the result being that you don't feel like you're earning any reward for playing. Even winning an entire game gives you maybe half a crate worth of points. The crates will just give you the same dirty wife beater over and over again. The drop rates for any of the good items are so low, it would take hundreds of hours of opening crates, literally sitting there opening crates, to get them. The developer's own published drop rates show this clearly.

-The developers care far more about the Chinese playerbase. Patches are timed at primetime for the US, typically with a 6-8PM downtime, sometimes twice a week. I can't imagine how frustrating this would be for someone with a normal job. Chinese players, including a shocking number of griefers, flood the North American servers at all times of the day, making random squad play unusable.

-It's still got some kinks, and it's not the prettiest game.


This game is fun at first, but you quickly realize what a horrible and hellish grind it is to play regularly. Playing with friends makes it more tolerable.

Desync, frame lag, playing against high ping players. parachute glitching, shots not registering.  Do they even have anyone working for them fixing this game or are they just sitting in a room Butt fuckign eachother on their piles of cash.

Honestly, it's the only game I spend time playing with my friends/family at the moment though, which is why I continue to play it. 

The cheating has gotten so bad that even if you're the most cautious of players you'll regularly have someone shoot you through a wall or find you when you're completely hidden. There are many times where I'm in the lobby of the North American server and I hear repeated recorded messages in Chinese. Run it through Google Translate and you'll get the gist of it - they are advertisements for ways to cheat at the game. There's also issues with Chinese players coming to play on the NA server. Many of them are just fine and play the game normally, but the game has issues with ping times. Add a high ping with a game that relies on the client's response for the outcome of a scenario and you've got players skipping around. You could aim perfectly from your point of view and still miss them because of this.

If you have friends that you want to play the game with, sure, go for it. It can be fun to screw around.

I'll be honest, the game has amazing mechanics and a good idea behind it... only there's a few issues that completely break the game and it's flow.

- The insane amount of RNG makes it impossible for even the most skilled of players to get a Chicken Dinner at times. You find a long-range weapon as opposed to your nerf gun of a SMG whilst you have next to no cover AND you have to move so the circle doesn't kill you... so you are then forced to run out of cover, waiting for your demise. Yet you somehow don't get killed by him, you get killed by the sucker sitting behind a rock 200m away with a pixel-worth of their head being exposed (impossible to notice with the shitty anti-aliasing options and how godawful the game pixelates if you have anything under a 1440p monitor). 

- In higher population areas, the tick rate of the server actually slows down. In theory, this puts less of a load on the server, meaning the server doesn't crash. Sounds good, right?

Unfortunately, that means that gunfights with more people in them (yes that also means war mode) have a HORRENDOUS amount of RNG simply because you are fighting with shitty tickrates, shitty netcode and a shitty loot spawn system.

- Not only that, but for anyone running anything other than an Intel-based system, you are shit out of luck. The developers are directly optimizing the game for Intel/Nvidia-based PC hardware, meaning that if you have an all AMD build (or even just a CPU/GPU), you are an afterthought. Unreal Engine 4 is also specifically designed for Intel/Nvidia setups as well, meaning you are DOUBLE SCREWED if you have something like an old FX-8370 or a FX-6300 (less so with the Ryzen CPUs, but still a noticeable drop). 


If you are like me, and you have a PC that is 6 years old and you just have a new GPU in to breathe some life into your PC, don't even think about doing well in PUBG... Your FPS will be around 60-90 at lowest settings if you are lucky to have a 1050ti/1060. CPU bottlenecks in any games these days are a reality if you have an AMD FX-Series CPU. 

For those that contributed to the marketing monopoly that Intel and Nvidia have over the gaming world now, congratulations, you successfully screwed over hundreds of thousands (and even millions) of people just looking to play games at the same level as their friends.",1535618905,1535618905,False,3,1,0.541984736919403076,1,True,False,False

This game has given me some of the most exciting moments i've experienced in any game I've ever played .

The entire game feels incredibly sluggish and stuttering and crashing happens far too often. Shit, even the crash reporter crashes every time I've tried. And it's not like my PC is to blame, with a gtx 1080. And somehow my game drops to like 30 fps every once in a while. The devs can't seem to do anything about these problems except make them worse. 

I would definitely steer clear of this game, at least in its current state. If somehow the game gets better or you can somehow ignore these issues, I would say that if you have friends to play with, then this game is great for enough hours to get your money's worth and more. Also, many seem to have problems with rampant cheaters, but I can say that I haven't ever seen someone that I 100% knew was cheating in all my hours. I guess people's experience on that one varies

Don't buy it. It was fun to start with, had great fun with friends on Erangel only. 
  Then they added Miramar. At first, I thought the new map was trash. Then I decided to have an open mind, and really give it a chance. That was a mistake on my part. On Miramar, you can expect little to no concealment, very little cover besides buildings and rocks (which is a personal complaint tbh.) However something that is bad and has affected both my friends and I, has been the invisible rocks and rises in the ground of what appears to be an inch that stops vehicles in their paths. Not only does this damage the vehicles if you're going at a high enough speed (always), it also damages your character. 
  Next up, were the hackers and cheaters. Early on, it's understandable for a ""new"" MMO game to have its shares of hackers who can shoot through walls, hills, and across the maps. Most of these hackers obviously came from a certain country located on the continent of Asia. However, despite questions into whether region lock could be added to deter normal folks who bought for a fun gameplay experience to not have to deal with hackers, they were told it was racist to even speak of such an idea. So now, forgetful Asians, as well as their in-game ad bots are populating the North American server as that was set as the default server.
  Now, on to loot crates, season passes, and the new map. PUBGCorps has decided to go down the path of another somewhat successful videogame studio in terms of how many microtransactions it can add to a single game. So, you now have to buy keys with actual money, rather than just the in-game currency which you buy crates with. You can see the confusion. To add to this, with the release of a pretty decent map known as Sanhok they also brought in the Event Pass. Now, you're able to complete missions and are rewarded with free loot! Unless, it's ""special event"" loot which times out after 30 days in which case you will lose it forever. But you get lots of free loot! Unless, it's Event Pass only loot. Then you have to buy an event pass to get it while also completing missions. But you get free loot!

[list][*] Horrible netcode (""E-Sports ready"")
[*] Intrusive (yet somehow still ineffective) anti-cheat
[*] The main menu STILL doesn't work the way it should. Sometimes teammates (and/or yourself, sometimes even the backdrop) are invisible. Sometimes it won't register a ""ready"" click. Sometimes it tells you that servers are too busy to change what I'd have thought was a client-side option concerning which map/mode you wish to play.
[*] This one's the big one. The developers are complete arseholes. Honestly, to clarify this would require its own list. So here goes: [/list]
[olist] [*] During Early Access PUBG Corp promised players that there weren't going to be crates added during Early Access. Guess what? Uhhhh.... SPOILER ALERT, [spoiler]they added crates [i]during fucking early access![/i][/spoiler]
[*] Lack of presumption of innocence following accusations by streamers. Not sure if they're still up to their old tricks but sometime during Early Access whenever a popular streamer accused a player of cheating or stream-sniping the devs would swing that banhammer with gay abandon, and then, upon complaint from the accused, demand proof of innocence. Not quite the way it should work, fellas.
[*] Fearing a repeat of the outrage caused by their broken guarantee concerning the implementing of the crates system during Early Access, they released the game in an unfinished state. Bugs aplenty, still shitty netcode, you get the gist. I suspect the reason they did this was so that they would no longer have been in ""Early Access"" stage upon the release of the Despacito Crate, which this time, could be opened [i]only[/i] with a key purchased directly from the developers, circumventing their promise.
[*] Calling anybody who's asking for region locks xenophobic. (Honestly, it's a good thing they're saying this, otherwise I'd have thought I was at some sort of disadvantage having teammates who don't speak my language or would kill me for no apparent reason while they themselves have to cope with lag and as such haven't really got much of a hope on our servers anyway. Phew! /s)
[*] Attempting to sue the developers of any other BR game for copyright infringement. Seriously guys, doesn't the FPP mode of the game give it a ""First-person shooter"" kinda vibe? You know, the term that came into use once ""DOOM clone"" became a genre of its own?
[*] Taking as long as they did to add map selection
[*] Removing map selection
[*] Taking a piss on all of the remaining playerbase who actually hold game quality in higher regard than monetisation options in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/578080/announcements/detail/3077529898698894565]this[/url] glorious letter. I'll quickly take this apart. They say that [i]""The goal [/i][of the whole loot-crate fiasco mentioned above][i] was to provide a fun system outside of the main game experience through item trading,""[/i] which is bullcrap because:
a) the goal of the system was monetisation, plain and simple
b) they forgot to mention in this lovely letter that they've since removed the ability to trade items dircetly.
They spit in the faces of those who say 'enough is enough' by blatantly admitting their [i]""team's goal is not to stop here, but to keep experimenting wih new systems and new content.""[/i]
[b]Oof![/b]
For now they've promised that all the BR maps will be provided to all players for free. Let's see how long that one holds.
They apparently [i]""began to explore how to offer premium content in new ways,""[/i] during the development of their new map, [i]Sanhok[/i]. Bullshit, they began that ages ago, as is self evident when looking at the lootcrate clusterfuck.
They announced a new ""Event Pass"" kinda thing which actually doesn't sound so bad, but does bring attention back to their money-grabbing antics.
[*] They stick a huge banner to the back of the plane, adverti$ing their invitational. And on the parachutes. As if it weren't enough to do that from the main menu.
[*] I'm sure there's shit I've forgotten, and even if I haven't, they'll be giving me more reasons for this view of them shortly, I'm sure.

Pros: 
-fun with friends
-scavange style gameplay
-fps gameplay
-massive player battles

Cons:
-0 graphics
-props (houses and such) are repetitive 
-a lot of glithches
-rubberbanding galore
-frames issue
-points not awarding
-you will never play this game on ultra settigns (not that ultra settings will look breath taking)
-no marker from where you are shot at (and now you all will say that is normal, ok but the sound doesnt help either) its close to imposible to figure where you are shot from - kinda spoils all my gameplay 
-0 progression
-the loot boxes are a bad joke

“It's quite disgraceful to see,” Greene said. “The Chinese player base is very passionate for Battlegrounds and they love our game."" 

""This kind of xenophobic attitude that a lot of Western players seem to have online is just disgraceful. It's 2017! We live on one big planet together! What the fuck? I'm quite ashamed of those players that shout these things out. We want to create a great space for everyone to enjoy across the globe and locking one region out ... I don't know what the fuck they’re thinking.""

What they're thinking is that an irresponsible game dev is making an unaccounted for massive amount of profit off a game by introducing the chinese market and not properly accounting for the effect that it will have on western servers where almost no one can find a match in four attempts of lobby jumping in which he will not encounter at least two chinese players who are completely unable to communicate. It's not xenophobia Mr. Greene, it's complete incompetence on your part to address the issue. In your native Irish, ""Fuck off.""

Off a comment on Polygon: 

"">launches game in a region of the world that is both massive in size and distant from the servers
doesn’t give them dedicated servers but helps them reroute their already laggy connections through additional lag creationg VPNs
players can no longer find team mates they can communicate or coordinate with, constantly die due to lag related issues

'They are all Xenophobes that what it is'"" -Greene
No Greene, you are just horribly irresponsible.""

The first few games had the game not running that well at all, with random crashes mid-game and with weird lagspikes, even while running from a very new SSD.

After the first few games there were barely any problems with the game crashing at all,  instead, glitches such as physics, other players seeing through walls, and bad performance overall were things I had to make my way through in the game.

While I do think that the game has a nice concept and good execution, if you disregard the problems I just mentioned, I just think that it wasn't worth buying and playing the game in Early Access due to the high price.

Since I've tried the latest available beta, I can say that I think they've really taken their time to fix many of the problems, and to be honest, I myself cannot do much more than hope that the 1.0 Release is close-to glitch-free.

Therefore I do not recommend buying the game until it has been released, solely for the reason that it's such a huge gamble, and you should wait for reviews to come up about 1.0.

While PUBG did not invent battle royale, it was my personal introduction to a genre that I have since then grown to love. But even with the rose tinted glasses that come with being my first, I would be disingenuous to recommend buying this game. This review will not cover any of the controversies such as the [url=https://www.pcgamer.com/pubg-corp-has-filed-a-lawsuit-against-epic-games/]lawsuit against EPIC[/url], or the seemingly tone deaf creator who has made statements such as, [url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-16-playerunknown-on-whats-next-for-pubg] “If you’re dying to the red zone, then I’m sorry but you’re not a very good player”[/url], but try to take an objective look at what makes PUBG a bad game, and an even worse purchase.

One of my main issues with PUBG is the pacing and length of the matches. PUBG matches will often last over forty minutes, assuming you make it to the top ten. While not an issue in and of itself, when paired with the pacing of the match, it leads to an unenjoyable experience that is only exciting during the first and last five minutes. I have spent the majority of my 315+ hours either running or driving to the enclosing circle, only to be killed by someone camping inside a house or behind a tree.

This is not a salty rant, but a fact about the game’s mechanics itself and how winning caters to those who go out of their way to avoid or vulture fights. There is no benefit to taking on and winning fights, as all gear (with the exception of the air-drop gear) can simply be found in and around the map, which in turn promotes camping. A stark contrast to a game such as[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/813820/Realm_Royale/] Realm Royale[/url] that encourages finding and fighting opponents in order to craft the best possible gear. Even the daily missions seem to push a more passive play style with requirements such as, “Survive for 15 minutes in Solos without taking or dealing any damage on Sanhok”. 

The experience is only made more infuriating when you suffer a premature death thanks to one of the many bugs that still riddle PUBG, even after leaving “Early Access”. I am not the type to expect a game to have no bugs after its full release, but when you can still be run over by your own car rolling at less than 1 mph after stepping out of it, then there is a problem. Not to mention the horrible server tick rate that can leave you taking damage from behind cover. 

[h1]Summary and Target Price Point[/h1]

[i]PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS[/i] is a [b]4.0 out of 10[/b]. It is a game that encourages avoiding your opponents and the majority of your time will be spent running or driving into campers, dying to various bugs and glitches, and taking damage when moving behind cover thanks to horrible server tick rates. Normally priced at $29.99, you can find [i]PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS[/i] for less with some patience, if you want to give the game your own verdict.

I started playing pubg before the Maramir map was introduced and I have to say, it HAD potential, it HAD a future, it HAD a good head on its shoulders. 
What is it now? Biased, cheater infested, bug riddled, greed pandered nonsense. 

I use to be able to play and have actual fun, top 1% maybe .85% in US but never really won a game except once which was pure luck and adrenaline and I am NOT a very good player. Now getting into a match is just a chore.

Heres where it went south for me:
Lootboxes: It was nice at first but then the introduction of keys came in; which made you conduct your way through a micro-transaction for some shitty outfit or skin. It has gotten more and more out of hand as more lootboxes are being introduced; and the concept of already unlocked boxes is being tossed out the window.
So a greedy company.

Optimization: Do you have any idea what a game looks like without thorough bug removal or maybe glitches that seem to give some know-it-all players the upper hand? Check this game out cause it surely will make your head spin with how much bs lies within it. From peeking through walls to cars or motorcycles detonating out of no where WHILE YOU MADE IT SO FAR AND HAVE A DECENT KILL STREAK. As well as many more; this Battle Royale game has more bugs than a rabid animal.

Cheaters: Let me be frank and say that not all the cheaters are restricted to china, I have caught alot of people from US, UK, Asia and Africa all using cheats that can:
A) Enhance speed
B) Snap their aim on a player 
C) Completely negate recoil

Blueholes, anti-cheat system is so god awful that it is practically non existant to the game itself. Might as well just throw in a server specifically dedicated on who can out cheat everyone else cause that's all this game is. A bunch of whiny shite's who cannot win or play fairly without sliding in a cheat.

Biased: Congratulations! You managed to kill a streamer! What do you get behind curtain one?
A BAN! WAY TO GO *clap clap clap*

Seriously though, good luck when you kill a live streamer...ANY live streamer. Cause the guys over at bluehole will smack the ban hammer down so fast on you, you'll be seeing stars. Not only is it streamers but its any salty s-o-b who reports you enough because you've played fair and maybe outsmarted them WITHOUT CHEATING.
Its crap care like this that ruins a game that has alot of potential like this.

UNPOPULAR OPINION ALERT: FORTNITE HAS BETTER MANAGEMENT AND OPTIMIZATION THAN THIS GAME AND I H A T E FORTNITE. (It's minecraft with guns -Albino 2018).

All in all, dont get this game, dont waste your time. Don't waste your money, just don't; this game will give you more frustration than joy. Sure you can argue that I'm just being salty to all of you PUBG lovers out there. I respect YOUR opinion that you love this game but there are some flaws that need addressing and ones that I myself cannot ignore.

Bluehole, smarten up, because you are way low on the bar. And simply saying ""We know we aren't optimizing everything well"" is just words not actions. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT OR GET OUT OF THE GAMING INDUSTRY MARKET.

UPDATE:
SHANOK MAP!

You guys wanna know what its like to crash everytime you die? Or perhaps clip through the floor...or maybe have someone blast you through a wall?
CHECK OUT PUBG'S NEW MAP SHANOK!

Jesus Christ, it's so infuriating to know that they totally half assed all the testing in this map.

No local servers?! you screwed, its a waste of money. Lagg is poor due to distance, poor netcode, and aeltency, nothing works. You will so often be killed when you @think@ you in or behind cover, but nope, the servers are so bad and useless, that they give you the middle finger and say....stuff you...i'm going to tell the other players your in the open....because the devs are useless at netcode...or a lot actually...

The ammount of bugs are everywhere, you will die because a rock teleported across the map and decided to randomly strike you...amazing thing is...rocks can't move in this game, that's how obsurd the bugs are, cars are a nightmare to drive becasue they buggy, poor and blow up for no reason, you often slam into invisible terrain or get teleported into the air.

You almost always take damage from the parachute drop...me personally, has lost health doing standard straight drops low speed imapct to ground and have taken damage 9 out of my last ten games, and thats literally not a lie, I counted it....9 games straight, some almost killing me, and ironically 10th game lucky, no damage.

This game is NOT competition ready, they lie, it's not a fair playfield, as you die from game breaking issues all the time.

Devs don't care about the community....

And i'm 100% positive that hackers are laughing so hard at thier garbage hacking prevention systems, 8 out of 10 games and you will die to hackers, or people using recoil scripts...how you going to stop people that have AHK mouse control recoil scripts hey? Some are smart with ramdomising jitters...you not stopping that...for that reason i'm not surprised so many of the people that rape me have the worldst greatest recoil control! EVERTIME THEY SHOOT ANYTHING!!!

This game is more frustrating than pleasurable now, thanks to lagg, hackers, recoil scripters and the underdeveloping devs.

Let me also say, the entire african contenant has not 1 server on it? WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Finally...be prepared to have HUGE upates everytime they change a word in the game, since they have developed it so retarded that they have to update what feels like 30% of the game just to update that 1 word change, so no matter what, there is no such thing as a small update...and all updates get an update to fix what they broke with the update the first time and its just as big!",1517657765,1517657765,False,3,1,0.541666686534881592,4,True,False,False

The Servers are unreliable and unstable, the gamephysics are ridiculous, (30.12.17)
the movement (for me) is ""slow"" and ""wobbly"" and by taking a closer look at the gameconcept, it consists 50% of luck...
But that's just a problem (for me) with Battleroyal-games in general. The start of every game and the end of every game consist (again in my opinion) mainly of luck. In PUBG (in difference to other Battleroyalgames) you are able to decide where you want to start on the map... but there is no garanty you get an AR or basically ANY weapon... and also Zone-luck is a huge topic...
You might argue that i'm just bad at this game and just f#ck up every round (dozens of wins) and that's the reason why i can't recommend it BUT i play mainly Shooter (BF3 ,Bf4 ,Bf1 ,StBf1, StBf2) around 2000h playtime and im quite competitive.. so this game is nothing fo me. And there are many problems that have nothing to do with Playerskill but with gameperformance and overall optimisation. Because it doesnt matter how high-end your PC is... you get WAY TO low-FPS for these graphics.
I'm sure there will be more performance-updates but im talking about the current state of the game. So in conclusion:
For some casual gamers this game can be fun, but i recommend you watch this game on streams... because PUBG is in my opinion a game what is ONLY fun to watch... and not to play. (Thx for reading even tho my english is not the best ^^)

The game was released in late March 2017 in its alpha state, meaning still in early development. During release, the game was borderline unplayable but it was okay because it was still early access, and was still, for the most part, an enjoyable game to play with your friends. Thankfully, Bluehole decided to add emotes to the game around March 2018 as a response to the plethora of bugs in the game.

Let's fast forward to September 2018 when PUBG finally came out of alpha stage to 1.0.

PUBG, otherwise known as 'Plunkbat' by the baboon RockPaperShotgun reporters, had yet to have any significant fixes after its 1.0 release. The game mechanics sucked, cheaters filled every server, bugs were still abundant, and many players would get banned for doing nothing. The game was and has been an abomination since release, except now it is unacceptable how terrible it is.

Fortunately for us gamers, Bluehole finally decided to step up their game after two entire years and fix their game with their all-new campaign ""FIX PUBG""! This campaign was designed to fix the game entirely to give players some hope in fixing their beloved PUBG. 

Following their awesome new campaign, Bluehole has done almost nothing but add more anti-cheat to the game since the beginning of FIX PUBG. They have done almost nothing for its players other than give BP as compensation for how much they suck at developing a decent playable game. You are required to have a $10,000 PC to play this game anywhere near 60fps. Additionally, the lobby GUI is completely unresponsive. You can't click a single button without having to wait 10 seconds for the sick new weapon progression screen to load. You can't even select a specific map to play on anymore; you're forced to play a random map.

PUBG is no longer an enjoyable game. I have yet to see any improvement other than some game mechanics and less cheaters. It is nothing less than a background process to suck up all of your RAM while you talk to your friends on Discord. 

The funniest thing about this new innovative FIX PUBG campaign is that instead of actually fixing the game, they added more emotes. 

I give this game a fat 0/10. Also, please stop calling it Plunkbat. It makes no sense.",1543894687,1574212089,False,2,0,0.541479885578155518,1,True,False,False

PUBG was a decent game with a great concept, but the developers slowly bled the game to a near-death state.
PUBG Corporation is a very good example of how a bad developer can ruin a good game with misguided and greedy decisions, from implementing new broken maps after months instead of fixing the net code or optimizing the game, to slowly transitioning the game into a microtransaction haven to a point where there's almost no way for your average player to get their hands on the item they want without paying actual money for cosmetic stuff .which no matter how you look at it, it might be ok for a F2P game, but not acceptable for a $30 game.
Optimization is a big issue with this game, it's still pretty playable of course but it shouldn't be no where near as demanding as it is right now since the game looks ok-ish at the highest settings.
This game could've been great if the devs got their act together, but honestly, they'd rather release new crates and lootboxes for their broken game than fixing it.

Hit reg goes from great to awful patch to patch with no explaination of what is happening. I have spent nearly a thousand dollars trying to get my PC to run this game well and it hasn't helped much. The movement is slippery feeling like you are always on ice and you are easily obstructed by things your character should be able to walk over. Getting into a game with friends or even by yourself is often a chore since they break the matchmaking UI every other patch. Only east coast servers in the US which seems a little cheap and scummy to do after making billions of dollars off us. 

More positive side:

I do think people are unfair to the devs when it comes to accusations of the game being full of cheaters and feel like most of them are mad about dying.

I could write a long list of the problems this game continues to have, from small quality of life issues to experience-spoiling one. But instead taking up half your day to read them all, I'll just mention a few big ones:

Problems with in-game audio would be the top of my list; hearing phantom footsteps in a game where audio is supposed to be the primary way to detect other players is simply unacceptable in a full release. The audio design is still generally ambitious, but fails to deliver on some basic things like audio balancing. Being defeaned by explosions might be realistic, but it doesn't make for a good experience to have to damage your hearing in order to listen out for other players.

At time of writing, it suffers from poor performance on the EU servers, to the point where it can be desync roulette to see who comes out of any given fight. After spending time working your way through a game to lose to a shooter continuting to hit you after you have stepped into cover, you can't help but feel like you wasted your time playing.

Last, but not least, the game is rampant with cheaters, to the point where it's hard to go by a single day without encountering somebody using a no-recoil hack, an aimbot or wall-hack. If Bluehole have taken steps to fight cheaters, they simply aren't effective at the moment.

[/i] However, that was before better, more optimized Battle Royale games became available. I have tried to give this game a fair chance since then and hoped it would improve from the unoptimized, clunky feel that this game is plagued with.  After an entire year of this game being ""fully released"" on Steam, and after nearly 9 months of the game being in Early Access, I cannot honestly recommend this game to anybody.  Let me explain in further details...

Over the year of being ""fully released"" (and I would use that term loosely), this game has supposedly undergone various performance improvements and optimizations.  Opening the game up on 12/27/2018, it runs almost identical to how it ran when it was still in Early Access. On a GTX 1080ti, i7 5930k @ 4.2 GHZ, and 32GB of 3000Mhz DDR4 RAM, the game fails to maintain 100+ fps on a 1440p/165hz G-Sync Monitor, [b] ON LOW SETTINGS. [/b] (With frames dropping below 60fps in some areas) While the i7 is aging, these specs are more than capable of handling games that offer much better visuals and at higher framerates.  While I know the game was built on Unreal Engine 4, most other UE4 games perform much better than this one.

Another major issue with this game is the clunky feeling of the gameplay.  You jump out of the plane, eventually your parachute opens up, and you land on the ground.  When you go to pick up your first weapon or whatever loot you find, you have to stand there spamming to pick it up with what appears to be some type of server-related lag issue.  This issue goes away within probably 30 seconds of your feet touching the ground but it is certainly still a potentially game-breaking issue as if somehow your opponent loots a weapon first and you are still standing there struggling to get your weapon to pick up, they can just freely mow you down.  The vaulting is slow as molasses, you literally can watch your character vault over a wall and get mowed down before you reach the other side, and just in general the controls do not feel as quick and responsive as they could be.

On a final note, I'd like to mention that this game does have the potential to be a lot better than it is in it's current state.  If only some of these issues were sorted out then the game would more than likely be a lot of fun, but unfortunately I don't see that happening after 9 months of Early Access, AND a year of this game being ""fully released"".",1545953980,1545954005,False,3,0,0.54106593132019043,1,True,False,False

UPD: after release they optimized it a little bit - my usual fps increased from 40 to 50. However, netcode is still suck - bullets are making blood when you shoot at air, and aren't making it when you shoot ar enemy.

First thing's first: do not listen to the people constantly shitting on this game or constantly worshipping it. It's a very good game with a lot of problems. I'll list some bullet points.

[list]
    [*]Performance is bad across the board and needs fixing. Lots of people are pissed about it. 
    [*]The loot box system is negatively weighted and the only good looking cosmetics are generally expensive.
    [*]The gunplay is very solid, feeling like a very polished, a bit more arcadey ARMA or DayZ.
    [*]The game has a ridiculous amount of players, but it's on a slight decline. Some say this is from cheaters being banned, some say it's due to game problems.
    [*]The game has two large maps with a third smaller one coming soon. A Russian island, Mexican land area, and small Asian island.
    [*]Cheaters are more common in the third-person mode than first-person. Both modes are viable.
    [*]Server de-sync is a serious problem and the tick rate is around 10 at the start of the game and 20 the rest of the way through.
    [*]The developers have a habit of hiding changes from patch notes and pushing shitty changes/bugs to live. They claim to be working on this to make it happen less often.
    [*]As a whole, it's an enjoyable experience with a large selection of weapons, vehicles, and general fun to be had, but until they fix performance so that top-end PCs get passable FPS, I cannot recommend this in good conscience.

I hear the attackers speeding off in a vehicle before i was close enough to attack. I go out of my way while being damaged by blue to find a way onto this roof and revive my remaining team member. Then I locate a buggy and go to pick him up from looting his buddies. What does he do? He shoots me in the face, KO's me and starts screaming at me in Chinese. I inform him i speak english. He revives me, then KO's me again with a frying pan. Rinse repeat, screaming at me the whole time like i am suposed to know what he is saying, he KO's me and revives about 5 times in total before I returned the favor and let him die took his meds and had to travel 3/4 of the way acrost the map to get back to zone.

Because most of that time is spent trying to get to the fun part of the game. At it's core, the gunplay in PUBG can be really fun and intense, especially with friends, and is what drives me to play this game. Unfortunatelfy, everything else about the game takes away from the gunplay and you have to deal with those aspects to get to the fun. 
     The horrible loot spawns, the network lag and de-sync, and the performence that, overall, has barely improved since launch. As of now, the performence and network lag is actually worse than it has ever been. When it comes to making and locking cosmetics behind expensive keys and adding graffiti to buildings, the devs are all over it. Improving performence on both ends is clearly a lesser priority and I don't see it improving any time soon to where it should be.
     You will spend most of your time in this game looking for loot. You can get really lucky and find a gun right away, or spend a good 15-20 min finding the same shotgun or pistol in every building, or finding nothing but clothing. Running in and out of the same buildings, opening doors to empty rooms gets discourgaing and boring as hell. I don't understand why loot is so sparse. Horrible design choice imo and leads to just huge wastes of time in between the action. As far as balanced loot spawns go, Fortnite does it better (Not saying one game is better or worse, but the loot spawns are way better in FN). I cannot take any more of this aspect of the game. I've reached my limit. Play something else that puts more empahsis on the fun. 
     And if you do decide to buy and endure this game, avoid the cosmetics keys. The loot drops are pathetically low. You will blow through a lot of money before getting anything good. This game, by far, has the absolute worst loot drop and rewards system of any game I have played.

Okay, at the start, this game was amazing... nobody can argue with that.

It was one of the best thriller games, the feeling when it's the 4th circle, 20 people were alive was fu*king scary... any moment you could get your ass penetrated...

But this game took a super quick nose dive to fucking *TRASH!*. Many people say it started to become shit since 1.0... but for me it's from the day they released the first tournament crate that needed to use keys. They said ""keys are meant to raise cash for the tournament"" but they penetrated us and started to sell crates... then gave a masive shoutout to Fortnite. by saying:
Tl;Dr
""Hey Fortnite, fuck you! you made a game some what similar""

6 months with basically just a bit of fixes and only *CrAtEs!!!~*

Then Xbox and Mobile release... kool but please keep PC alive.

then they released couple of weapons and cars... still Mada Mada... as they used to release shit like that like hot cakes when the game was in early access.

Then current time arives. Samhok!~

Good fucking map, it's actually fun (comparing to another map ;) )

but 2 fucking problems:

1) the battle pass. like fuck sake... it was a 100% copy from Fortnite... let's compare. Fortnite - Game is fucking free, the pass takes 12 weeks, items are perma. Costs?  both Cost - 10Eu / USD

also, to get the items without the battle pass, you need to play 28 days straight, everyday at an average 6 hours.

Now let's see what PUBG Does that Fortnit'on't.
- Costs 30 EU. gives crates that require to buy keys (and it used to fun to sell shit on the marketplace. It was a nice addition, it gave cash to people who played the game a lot and kept it alive to spend money on other games or ++ their looks.

2) The fucking lawsuit... like are they fuckin' dip shits??? they gave even more publicity to Fortnite and thank god they backed down... but they lost the trust of their consumers and please fucking downvote this game to infinity.


It's suprising how they can get a game from 90%~ posititve to 30%~... that is bigger talent than it was required to make this game.

Now please downvote this game to infinity.

It wasn't until i had a really bad breakup that soon I found PUBG, a game that helped me get my mind off what had happened.
I dropped a few hours on during the initial release, then a few more and more and more until I realized.
""I'm no longer retired""
I became addicted and rightfully so, despite all the bugs and issues the game was fun, it was amazing and anyone who loved the game at the beginning could only hope that it would get better. Right?

WRONG! Because if there's one thing that this game taught me is how to turn Hope into sheer, utter disappointment.

I wanted to continue loving this game, I wanted to give it another chance, I wanted to put more time into it.
But the game never improved, there were a few ""tweaks"" but the game's performance has barely gotten better, the amount of bugs still present can be comparable with one of the crappy Early Access games that can be found all over Steam.

However, that didn't stop the developers from putting in more Microtransactions into their game, instead of focusing their time towards improvement.
There was none and when there was, it very little.

The game is still fun, there is no deying it, but I would never recommend this game to anyone.
Not when it's focusing on ruining itself rather than improving itself.

I decided to give the game one more shot, to see if I can still get the thrill and emotion from when I first got it, however, It's very unlikely that'll be case.

All I can say is, buy it at your own risk, I highly reccommed against it, but ultimately the choice is yours.",1532635755,1532635755,False,3,0,0.53947371244430542,0,True,False,False

- Gunplay : It actually feels like each gun has some skill requirements shooting.

- New content that is FREE after purchase of game of course. Maps, guns,vehicles,gun attachments.

- A good battle royale if you're looking for somewhat realism. No special abilities, building, or any other crazy powers to look out for.

- The Event/Battle passes aren't that bad if you wan't more cosmetics. The only problem is if you're willing to grind out the missions to get them. Then its a CON but then again you don't need to buy it.

Cons

- Laggy Servers. There's been significant desync since the beginning of the game. Probably won't disappear anytime soon.

-Game integrity: The game puts a lot of stress on your computer if you're on the lower end PCs.

-Movement/parachuting: Player walking movement can seem slow and clunky. Parachuting still after changes isn't the best.

-Only map that you might get nothing decent Miramar.

-Sound: Some sounds don't register or too loud (Bombs,Flares). If you crouch walk up a steep hill, you're completely silent. (Not sure if it is intended). Also they added a key-chain sound when you walk/run now, it's kind of annoying.

-Spectate and replay are imperfect. 

- THE WORST CON IS THEY NEVER FIX THESE PROBLEMS OR THEY TAKE WAY TOO LONG. There's still a bug where visually there's loot in a shack in Pai Nan Southwest Edge where you can't pick it up.

PUBG, another game that got screwed up by its own developers. Let's go back in time a bit. PUBG as an early acces title had a lot of problems, like a huge TON of problems. But hey, it was still fun and a promising game with a great potentional to the future >>> aiming for better performance and lesser bugs. Time went by and PUBG got truly better. The peak of performance and balance of everything was back in 2018 in January or February. In another words, the update where character render was broken, replay was broken and maybe couple more things were broken. But don't get me wrong. When you turned off all these stuff, that are more or less absolutely useless for your gameplay experience, you suddenly got the highest FPS you have ever seen in PUBG. For me it was 144 FPS even in big cities. Hitboxes worked and servers had an OK latency. But that didn't last too long. Bluehole decided that these bugs needed fixing. They didn't repair it till this day, even more, they came up with a new anticheat that broke the game to the core. From that day, the game went from bad to worse and down to horrible. To top it off, Bluehole decided to profit on our loss even more through skins and now event pass. RIP PUBG 2017-2018.

Now to the pros and cons, separately for the best patch and live patch:

2018 ""broken replay"" best FPS patch ever:
+ performance at its best, 144 FPS in big cities
+ optimized weapons and maybe even hitboxes
+ optimized Miramar as a relatively new map
- not working replay (I don't use it anyway)
- broken character render in the inventory (who needs that anyway)
- couple speedhackers in TPP

2018 every patch onward:
+ more complex settings for UI and controls
+ more weapons and vehicles
- poor performance in cities and stuttering even though high FPS >>> client performance
- getting hit when already behind wall, latency >>>server performance
- hitboxes
- anticheat (not even working, one of the reasons of poor performance)
- money content (event pass, skins)

To summarize it. PUBG aimed to be the best battle royale FPS game ever. Till the one point it was. Now it is becoming ""not even worth playing"".",1529586277,1529586419,False,6,0,0.539227545261383057,0,True,False,False

THE PROS:

The game is absolutely terrific to play. The gameplay is something that I really really enjoy, the overall mechanics, the basic idea and the design of the game really appeal to me. The guns handle great in my opinion, if you are a casual player like me it's still an easy task to get used to the sistem. The loot system is also great for this type of game, I prefer the random loot over knowing what loot is where; sure you can get shafted if you loot a whole house and all you have to show for it is a foregrip and a sickle, but that for me is part of the fun.

As mentioned before I am not a pro player so my hearth starts to race when I get into a top 5 situation, but I am starting to get used to it. Playing with friends is also a blast.

THE CONS:

That said, I bought this game when it was in beta like most people, it was great fun if a bit of a buggy experience, but hey, it's an early acess game, you know what you are getting yourself into. The updates on the test server were regular and you can see that Playerunknown and Bluehole really care and want this game to be the best there is.

And this is why I am so confued over why the hell they already released it. It's not a finished experience. I have two computers, one with a GTX 950 and one with a GTX 970. Now, the final version of the game is optimised performance-wise but looks horrible. Even on the very lowest settings at 1080p it requires just shy of 2GB of video memory. This means that no matter how strong of a card you might have, if you have 2GB of video memory you will not be able to set the settings higher than the absolute lowest. And if you do it seems like the game blocks the texture settings and everything looks like its made out of Play-Doh. On the 970 it's a bit better, the graphics look okay but get beaten by really old games like Battlefield 3, at least in my opinion.

That's if you care about graphics, which I really don't so lets get to the core problem: Bugs and rubber-banding. The bugs are mainly present on the title screen, it's difficult to get into and leave a game sometimes. But when you do, oh man does the early game experience blow. The rubber banding is extreme and it persists for about five minutes, five most important minutes in the game if you land in a populated area and this for me is unnaceptable when talking about a finished game. The tickrate is also abysmal, but i don't notice it so much so let's say it wont get in your way.

In the H3H3 Podcast Brendan said that that there will still be updates after the full version releases, so why release it in this state at all? I have high respect for Brendan and Bluehole and wish them all the best, but untill they fix these very basic issues (WHICH I KNOW ARE NOT EASY TO FIX) I unfortunately won't be able to recommend this game. That said, I very much look forward to the update that will change my review.",1513851742,1513851742,False,6,0,0.538931548595428467,0,True,False,False

This game was great. I was enjoyed over 400 hours. I played with friends or solo almost every night. I think this is the best game in 2017.

But I can't play the game anymore. I have been falsely banned.

I never use any cheat or macro tools, There are no malware or virus in my PC. I never done teamkill or teaming, streamsnipe or something like that, I believe I never violated any PUBG rules. 

And my account may not be hacked. I use Two-step authentication.

Of cource I sent message to support. but they said ""Not false ban"", And they never explain why I am banned.

I think something software is detected as cheart tool. but I'm not sure. There is no other reason I thought.

If you want to play PUBG, Don't install any other softwares. Otherwise you will be falsely banned.

This game had so much potential, all wasted due to the lack of effort from the developers. Where do I even start? PUBG is full of game breaking bugs, Chinese hackers and to top it off the devs keep introducing new (not to mention useless), in-app transactions. This is the first PC game i've ever played to employ TEMPORARY PREMIUM COSMETICS; you pay real money for cosmetics that just expire after a period of time and have to be bought again.

The battle pass introduced isn't worth it either. If only the devs could focus on fixing the game, there would be some chance of it being able to compete with the rest out there. Textures don't load till a couple of minutes into the game, even on hardware running at relatively higher specs. The game physics break hard and often. Cars go flying. Grenades go through walls. Recently there have been server desynch issues as well.

Honestly, at this point i'm fairly convinced that Blue**** is only trying to milk the game to the last of its moments and has already given up on trying to save/salvage it. Hence, save your money and go get something else.",1533617232,1533617232,False,4,0,0.538461506366729736,0,True,False,False

Sometimes those silly bugs would give us endless hours of entertainment, othertimes they could be infuriating. What we didn't know is that they'd take that money we gave them and instead of fixing the many bug or making the game better, they produced a mobile version of the game, and they made a console version of the game and we, the people who made this game possible, the people who gambled with our own money that this publisher would provide us finished content at some point in time. Those of us who told our friends to get this great game were shoved to the backburner and completely let down. The game is still not finished, and the publisher has instead of rewarding the people who paid them the capital to really help their game take off, has instead decided to reward us with 100s of microtransactions and a game that doesn't play better than the pre 1.0 build. They took many things that we players enjoyed out of the game, and they continously don't listen to the community. 
I highly suggest not buying this game, just  on the principle of not endorsing such behavior. 
I would also suggest that Steam introduce a cluse in there ""Greenlight"" program that states that if a developer makes a game for steam Greenlight and users pay for it.

It is just unplayable, also having everything on low will make the resolution so bad that you wont even see people in the distance, only as some pixels. So yea, this is really a bit unfair of a review but they should give at least a low specs mode. This is also what i hate about unreal engine, it really requires a beefy PC to run most games. I did everything to make it run as fast as possible, but it just doesnt want to. If they would optimise it, i would recommend them to look at the resolution, because playing at a low 3D resolution makes up for a crap experience.

The report feature does not work and those players that are blatantly hacking are continuing to run un-detected and advance on the leaderboard in spite of very obvious cheating.

To top it off -- the suppression of people expressing legitimate concerns about hacks and cheating on PUBG's forums AND on Reddit is unforgivable.

Much must be done.
Region locking; raising the price; IP banning; pursuing hack developers; etc...

Edit: In my attempt to give this game another shot, it was still a waste of time. Now they have implemented crates that you have to purchase keys to unlock (2.50/key) and you receive items that are worth a couple of cents on the marketplace. There are numerous glitches in the game that make it unplayable. Not to mention the cheaters. Yes they have put in to place a report player option. But that does not stop it from happening. This game is easily one of the worst shooters i have ever played. Please for the love of GOD, do not purchase this game. And if you already have, do not feed into the crate/key scam.

Edit: have recently come back to this game after a year or so of hiatus. there has been a ton of improvement on the game.

This game will never truely be compeitive until we get private moderated servers and the leaderboards cannot be trusted with the amount of cheaters per game, this all makes the invitational out to be an even bigger joke.

Instead of fixing the main issues, they just pump out crates and skins. (even though they said there was gonna be no microtransactions)
They add maps without even fixing the optimization.

It's like they stopped caring about the game itself and only care about milking the shit out of it now.

There are just better alternatives out there like fortnite.. Fornite is more cartoony and aimed towards kids, But atleast it works, The combat is smooth, the gun play is fun, it runs well and there is content coming out almost monthly.

The player base is leaving. Upto 200,000 players are stopping playing this game every month.. My advice is wait, Give the game a couple a months and see what direction it is heading in.. If in a couple of months time things have changed i will happily come back and change my review.. But until then i'd stay away from this game.

The new map was clearly not my favourite but i had some decent rounds there aswell..
But the fact that i was nearly forced to play this map which i dont like really striked me.
Furthermore the developers contiuosly released new skins for your character and new weapon skins to the game but it seems like that some kinda annoying bugs wont befixed at all..

Only CounterStrike do such fucked up things like this and i also didnt liked it there...
Adding a paracute-skin for 5€ and some streamer-cases for 10€ each made things even worse..

However, there are a lot of issues with the game that I'd like to detail, as well as explain why I'm struggling to give this game a positive rating.
1) I run this game on an SSD, and with most games by the time I load in I'm either dead or in a far flung corner of the map. I have also got a 1060 and 16gb of DDR4 RAM and I still get this issue.
2) A lot of microstuttering on a regular basis makes the game unplayable
3) This is an issue from the past, but the way the game handled (and to a degree still does handle) financing via Microtransactions (MTX) is scummy. I bought the Sanhok pass and within a few hours all my rewards were removed because of some temporary timer bullshit. What's more is that the market is massively restricted and almost nonexistant.
4) In general, the way the game performs on my high spec system is a joke. I constantly have sound issues as well as the aforementioned microstutter and general slow load times that put Fallout 4's Release version Elevators in a good light.

Overall, when the game runs properly, the gameplay is fun and they are adding new content semi-frequently. They really need a proper FixPUBG initiative where they don't just add new UI and they say ""we fixed the game lol""",1545247933,1545247933,False,2,0,0.536874771118164063,2,True,False,False

the devs are greedy a******s that introduce f*****g lootboxes, the very thing that is about to be prohibitted because it's considered to be gambling mind you, instead of just fixing the f*****g game.

We don´t need a new car and a new weapon or a mobile version, first optimize this buggy mess, because as of right now its barely playable (and it's supposed to be a finished game lol)

the good:
+it's a fun concept and it would be an awesome game if it was well implemented
+it's f*****g addicting because you get pumped full of adrenaline in the final circles

the bad:
-poorly optimized
-it's like  a 5 tickrate or some ridiculous number
-client side hit detection *facepalms*
-poor hit registration (even though you are clearly hitting the shots, they don't register even when you see a huge f*****g mist of blood coming out of the guy's head)
-NETWORK LAG DETECTED (really? a sign that tells you the very problem you're experiencing due to your sh***y servers?)

You and another 99 players jump out of a plane into a huge inhabited map (there a diffierent maps), you have only your clothes and a simple bag that is empty. Once you hit the ground you have to acquire guns, ammo and equipment that is scattered through the map. You have to search for them into abandoned buildings and houses. Once you are packed you can  try to find another players and kill them or, you can hide and wait. As time passes a zone in the map is marked, players must get there in a given time, otherwise their health start to drop until they die. As the number of players is reduced, the game zone is reduced as well. Finally you end up fighting in a small area, until only 1 player remains alive.

My review (It's my humble opinion after playing it for about 2 days and  ending TOP20 on almost 70% of the games):

It is a nice game based on a great idea, but not a big deal in the end. In fact it becomes really boring after 10 hours of gameplay. Further work and contents must be applied to make it more interesting to actual players and possible new players.
I just bought it because the game's loot gives you the chance to turn it into cash to be able to buy stuff for other games. I think this would be cool until the market prices get too low to be able to buy any other stuff.

The graphics simply do not justify that. With older hardware many people struggle to get the game running decently. Aiming (compared to cs) feels slow and sluggish if you don't turn down the settings.

- Rather than fixing the game, devs seem to care more about cosmetics and dlc's.

- The amount of cheaters increased over the time. At least they TRY to do something against it.

- hitboxes couldn't be worse.

- Skin cases have ridiculous low drop rates for high tier items.

- Bad connection / servers

- definitely NOT e-sport ready (became a meme already)

- the devs are changing thing in the game just for the purpose of changing them, not because it makes any sense.
5 different grips? Seriously? Constant recoil changes, damage changes that are unnecessary most of the time.

- Some weapons feel way to random, which can mostly be explained with bad hitboxes and servers.

Nowadays its a cheat-orgie with: autoaim, norecoil, cratespawn and other general hacks. This overall kills the experience for me and many others. We encounter a cheater 1 out of 3 games and sometimes even more, or we are lucky alittle less.

The point being that 1 cheater can ruin the game for 100 people.

Things that needs to be addressed:
1. Region lock (china being overrepresented in pubg hacking scene)
1. Ghost parachutes (parachutes not rendering, so you think you are alone.. but arent)
3. Pause the lootboxes until you have adressed the hacking problem! The sole reason for all these hackers are these lootboxes wich they can sell.

I would recommend this game becouse it has given me so much joy and good memories. But now the story sadly isnt that any more, its to much frustration with all these hackers.

Hackers galore, Inexcusable lag, Anti cheat that is based on the hours you have and the amount of kills you have per game *(will explain later on)*, and the lazyness of the devs. I started playing this game about 1 year ago, and back then it was honestly one of the best games i had ever played, especially seince it was the first battle royale game I had ever played. I'm a casual player who generally only plays this game with friends, so most of my hours spent in this game have been in squads on the good ol' map; back before hackers ruled the game. ( and no, it wasn't a good player, since I don't think even a good player could headshot you while you are prone in the upstairs of a house with a pistol.... Just sayin)
Lag has always been an issue in PUBG since the very beginning, especially in the beginning of the matches when you first land. Back about a year ago this was never really an issue, as we knew it was in early access and just rolled with it; since we knew it was (hopefully) going to be polished and profected in the future. Welp, 1 year later and we are still haveing inexcusable lag in matches, not just at the start, but throughout the entire game; its like their servers aren't meant to handle this many players playing their game. 
Now, their anti cheat is good in thought, but very impractical while in actual use. To get more than 6 kills in a game, you need 200 hours, to get 10 kills you need 500 hours, and in order to get 20 kills, you need to get 1000 hours in the game. 
So, if you have a friend that just started playing, and only has 98 hours, are really good at fps games such as armam and get 7 kills, they are banned within 24 hours; This counts for event also, such as the war event that is taking place currently. A firend of mine found out the hard way and now bought a 4th account, just so we could play together still on weekends.
Now, in order for a game to be successful, you need updates regularly, and changing the speed of the playzone doesn't count either... The last update this game has had was when it was released fully back in December, and that was the AUG. I admit, new guns are fun at times, but when the game is still struggling to run even on good pc's, thats what they should focus on; not by pleasing the youtubers and content creators with new guns to try to reel them back in to this pos game.
I loved this game in the beginning, but to all you who are thinking about getting it, i'd suggest saving your money till the issues get fixed.",1523728071,1523728071,False,2,0,0.535998284816741943,0,True,False,False

They have ignored the outcry of loyal, longtime players for change when it comes to region locking game servers.

I don't mind playing a game with people who don't speak my language. I don't mind it every once in a while. But when I sit down to play PUBG, in a North American server, there should be some English-speaking players at least every so often. I started playing again a few days ago after a year long hiatus (back when region servers had purpose), and so far, after around twenty or thirty, maybe more, matches, I have played with a total of three English-speaking players.

This isn't about not liking Chinese people. I've even tried to learn some Mandarin to ease the in-game struggle of communicating during intense moments and pathfinding strategies. But this doesn't make any sense. The amount of Chinese players in the North American servers is absurd and unacceptable.

And Bluehole has ignored the overwhelming response to the issue. Now you have to go out of your way to find an English speaking community in PUBG for the NORTH AMERICAN servers, just so you can enjoy playing. But the way I see it, this is as much a problem with the game as any technical aspect that might cripple a player's experience, and if the game's broken, I won't recommend it.

I loved PUBG when it came out. I'm trying to stick around and keep enjoying it, but I don't see myself staying on too much longer. There are other games that work as intended, with region locked servers that make fucking sense.

Almost a year since I first reviewed. Whilst some in-game issues have been fixed, hacking is still prevalent, and a large number of issues still exist. Desync is rife, and for Australians this game is horrendous. Apparently the player count is so low that unless you are playing squad you are put onto SEA servers with 300ms ping (compared to 15-25ms). This rules out any competitive solo play for Australians.

***Old Review***
with nearly 655 hours on record i think it's time to make an honest review.. the tl;dr will be up the top, the detail below...

This biggest issue - Devs need to resolve the in-game issues prior to creating new content, and they’ve proven so far they’re not interested in doing this. If you want a game with high developer presence, making changes that are right for the community, find another game. This has gotten worse with the increase in popularity, and will not stop anytime soon.
The detailed review will cover the following:
-	Lack of in-game fixes
-	In-game server lag
-	Community abuse
-	Negative choices affecting the community

Whilst there are many reviews that comment on people being incorrectly banned for stream sniping, i’m yet to encounter this and cannot comment on it.
Lack of in-game fixes:
I’m amazed that this game has gone as far as it has, when there’s so many in-game issues. From a design perspective, I can’t understand why there are buildings everywhere that have trees coming through the walls, and it’s been like this since Early Access date. I doubt it would be difficult to identify errors and rectify them so that the game actually looks ‘polished’ in some manner. With new patches have come more issues and no hot fixes. I can’t count how many times i’ve attempted to pick up a weapon, and it’s in my inventory, but I can’t wield it, and it doesn’t have a bullet count. The only way to fix this is to drop the weapon, and re-equip it. In populated and risky areas, this is not something you want to deal with. I also can’t tell you how many times i’ve shot at someone who didn’t have a weapon and who had EMPTY hands, only to have them shoot back at me. There are far too many in-game glitches that are affecting smooth game play at this timeframe to be able to support it, given the timeframes the glitches have been around.
In-Game Server Lag:
Their servers make me think they chose to be hosted by Niantic. Constantly attempting to log in only to find out they have terrible capacity management and I’m getting hit with “too many logins”. Each game is so hit and miss. One game you have a fantastic connection, the next you’re rubber banding around the map, and you can’t maintain an easy swivel when doing something as simple as parachuting to the ground.
Community Abuse:
The amount of in-game aimbots and hackers that have become more and more prevalent since October is unbelievable. How they haven’t written in a simple code to identify people who achieve multiple headshots and consistent headshots in a short period, and reviewed their activity is beyond me. Yes there are accounts being banned, but there’s more appearing than there are disappearing. It’s a drastic issue that needs to be rectified.
Negative choices affecting the community:
The developers know of the issues that this game is facing. The glitches, the problems, the delays. These have been reported numerous times, yet they have instead focussed on bringing out newer content which can be just as flawed, instead of fixing the issues already in-game. On top of this, one of the biggest kickbacks this game had was the introduction of a crate system during early access. It showed that the developers were geared towards their profit margins more than they were completing this game and getting it out to the public. Yes, we can all accept that a game needs to find a way to survive, whether that’s monthly subscriptions, or in-game purchases, but to introduce it during early access is a slap in the face to the community.",1513675881,1549364330,False,3,0,0.53562009334564209,0,True,False,False

NOT PLAYABLE at CURRENT state , more HACKERS appear every day, 9/10 times dead by hacker, rubberbanding/laggs at the beginning of the game are worse than 3 updates ( roughly 6 weeks) ago. 3-player motorcycle is a deathtrap, kar98 has been nerfed to bits ( slower bullet and more bulletdrop than the sks, mini-14), cant remove/change map preferences. ( i dont want to play a gaint sandbox with some stones n bricks, fairly disappointed in the map itself and the amount of time it took to release it. 

pro's 
- ( for the first 6 months) every week an update with fixes, buggs etc. every month some content to add, may it be a weapon, vehicle or changes to the map. 
- a concept that doest die out, it stays fun, specially with a couple of friends ( ~890 hours of gameplay)
- the vault system is great, works good, no reall downsides to it. 
- Replay and death cam system ( except from the delay/ shown lag in it) works decent

cons
- the dev-team is currently WAAAAAY too busy trowing new additional content in the game, rather than fixing the existing problems. BAN HACKERS, maintain balance, you cant build on bad foundation. they reply to have patience because of the small dev group of 30 - 35 people. i think you made enough money to deliver 100 people paychecks ( 3mil concurrent players, dont trash around braggin about it when you cant sustain it)

existing big problems of today are ; 
- HACKERS are not DEALT with SERIOUSLY ENOUGH. STRIKE the BANNHAMMER. 
- Game optimization, lag and rubberbanding, serverstrength
- possibility of changing game files and/or using 3rd party programs to get visual advantages ( no grass, leaves, etc) 
- no REGION LOCK, plenty of people either abuse the high latency they get from the distance, and second part CHEATERS/HACKERS. 
- no map switching/disabling
- implements death cams but cant the last 3 minutes of death footage to connect and sent together as a report about hackers. 

Statistics have shown; 
- 90% of all banned PUBG hackers were from Asia - china ( 
- 60% of all PUBG playerbase is asia - china , ( PUBG corporation buying some concurrent players there to buff the numbers? its like Twitch fake viewerbots right? ) 
- 10% of all the users are cheating/hacking in one way or another( heavily griefing, 3rd party advantages or full 3D minimap, aimbot, wall and speedhacks)

and these numbers are only known from the people that actually received the bannhammer.

things that HAVE to be changed before playing again; 
- region lock and instant optimized hack preventions
- removal of possibility to change game files to advantages ( the graphic options in the settings should be the only way to minimal/maximum change the graphical looks of the game. 
- no more rubberbanding, ( a bit of lagg is understandable but current state is unplayable) 
- did i mention INSTANT HACK PREVENTION, and ACTIVE, VALUABLE reportsystem ( quicktip, if a report of player is sent, automaticly add the last 3 mins of gameplay to the complaint. dont cry about not enough employers for these matters, you claim to have an amazing playerbase community, steal the CSGO system, let 25 random people watch the same 3 min footage to decide if there is a hacker involved. if obvious, banhammer, when doubt let a dev check it out. ) 

best solution? make all hackers connect to the same blacklisted servers dedicated to hackers)(also region locked), they stop playing within a week when they only encounter other hackers that are even worse. P.S. Dont forget to build an entire server complex specially for Asia - china, you are going to need the blacklisted space ;)

Taking a break untill adressed problems are improved/dealt with. my assumtion? the playerbase will schrink abd die significantly if hackers arent going to be dealt with sooner than later.",1515031335,1515031335,False,4,1,0.535534799098968506,0,True,False,False

But by far the biggest negative change in this game is the looting phase, which has always been very long and kinda of annoying, but instead of improving this by adding in better loot spawns in more locations and better weapons more often, they did the exact opposite where they made it virtually pointless to go to any location other than super hot spots.

""I WANT MY PINK SHIRT BACK!"" ""Do you even go here?"" Classic. She had her whole life ahead of her and what'd she do? Same thing this game does. Refused adivce. Now a drunk drug fueled husk of a person she limps through life a nobody. Maybe she will one day have a revival and be the star we all know she can be. Doubt it. At this point shes too old her window is gone but I've been wrong before. Example when I downloaded this game. From the worst hit boxes Ive seen requiring you to dump magizine after magazine of 7.62 into a target armed with a biker helmet and a frying pan. To laggy hacking opponents who run rampent in this unoptimized mess of a game screaming china numba wan!. Vehciles will flip wildly as you hit nothing, guns will unload themselves after you put them on the ground by accident. Friend needs a backpack? Well you cant carry this level 3 back pack in your backpack so put a point on the map so he can come get it. Choose from a variety of guns that come in 4 different calibers. 9mm, 45acp, 7.62, 5.56. Because thats all that exists guys dont research into it. This game took ages to get vaulting, you know that thing we were all doing on ps2. It still doesn't allow for higher calibers to shoot through walls. So that guy hiding behind that 2x4 fence hes gonna be okay Margret hes gonna be okay. Did you get a well placed shot headshot across the map Johnathan? No problem there is no way in hell youll finish him off as hes down. Hell just crawl away get revived and come back to snipe you. Enjoy endlessly downing your opponents with no real repercussion as they have the advantage of being revived over and over again until eventually they get you.

Other games are coming out like RoE and Fortnite already optimized and reasonable. Most are free on top of that. But Lindsay isn't giving anything away for free no sir. She isnt the loveable scamp from parent trap we all like to think she is. You guys are awful. Soon people will say the same thing.

The cheaters outpace the anti-cheat software. By the developers own admission, about 99% of the cheaters in the game are from China.

Faster parachuting (why not?)

[h1] Player Unknowns Battlegrounds is f*cking sh*t [/h1]

After the frog lickers who made H1Z1 decided to ruin the game and their source of income, Brendan Grenne, PUBG creator, fume inhalor and part time ASMR pedophile on the deepweb decided to fill the void by providing the world with his own version of Overwatch. As you can see the game failed entirely, with only a pittiful 3 million all-time peak of players and only making it to the #1 most played game on steam... Which really isn't all that impressive considering Steam has been dead platform since the Windows Store came to PC in tandem with Origin and Uplay's undeniable rise to power.

I will give it to PUBG, it really kicked off the Battle Royale genre. It really paved the way and showed the world where the real gap in the market was... Just in time for a team of actual developers to sweep in and make Fortnite. But enough history, why can't I reccomend PUBG? Well, really, its really simple really. PUBG is total and utter wank from a gameplay, design and functionality perspective. 

Every time you get into a game expect to drop to 30 frames per second just for the loading screen, if you get past the loading screen then feel free to enjoy the numerous sh*theads who love blasting sh*t music from ""Em and Em"" and ""Kendick Lemur"" while simultaneously telling me to ""DrrrOp ScHeeoOl"" in a variety of exaggerated european accents.

If you're lucky enough to make it to the point where you have to jump out of the plane you have two choices, you can land somewhere, or you can unequip your parachute, die, turn off the game and play something else. If you make the wrong choice you best choose wisely where to land, the map around you has many locations, linearised by the sh*tty planes that only take you through to the bottom left area of the map, then further linearized by the shear amount of nothingness on the map and then EVEN FURTHER LINEARISED by your expectation that the zone will be nowhere near where you want it to be. Once you realise these 3 truths you are left with 1 areas to drop on either map.

[url=https://imgur.com/a/gcq8y] Here's a detailed image analysis of the original map [/url] 
and 
[url=https://imgur.com/a/iAYRS] here is that for the new map [/url]

Once you've carefully analysed these two images you are ready to drop at either Rozhock or Impala. If you're lucky you'll get into a fight early, die and move on with your life. However if you win you're most likely going to spend the next 25 minutes looting location after location until the zone centers on a desolate flat where the scopes are king and you'll get gunned down within 18 seconds or your money back.

But picture this right... You're among the last 2 left alive. A 1v1 scenario. The winner is truely the more skilled of the two right? Not really. You just lie down in a bush and if they don't poke their heads out you just pray that the coinflip zone lands on your head instead of theirs. Lets be honest though... You're never even getting into the top 10. You'll either die to the zone or die of bordem trying to find someone to shoot. Speaking of, this is a point that really can't be emphisised enough, the mid game of PUBG is SO F*CKING BORING. You move from compound to compound looting what hasn't already been looted and following the zone until you and your entire squad gets knocked from 2 kilometers away by a South Korean tribe of hill people all wielding Kars, 8 times' and 18 years worth of Esports experience.

What else... Oh yeah, the game runs like WANK. UTTER... WANK... I'm running some pretty good specs on my PC with a recently updated GPU and pleanty of everything else to go around but if I don't have motion blur on (which makes me feel sick as f*ck btw) then the game practically pauses and asks if it'd be more helpful if I had my monitor turned off. Oh and while we're at it. Lets talk about bugs. Type in ""esports ready"" for a full explanation on how, what can only be described as ""the skyrim of Battle Royales"", managed to turn itself into a meme. Lets also talk about what inspired me to write this review. Old map loading. After playing on sh*tty impala-ville for a solid hour I would have LOVED to join my friends on an old-map match but this weird thing happened where Mr.Grenne popped out my screen, spat in my eyes and told me to go f*ck myself for trying to appreciate the one good place in this game - Georgopol Crates.

I've played since early access so ik what im talking about, this company is slow as shit when it comes to fixing anything in this game or just improving things, apex legends came out and absolutely humiliated them from how polished it is compared to pubg, its preference which is better but apex legends a lot more polished than pubg has ever been and it actually felt like passion was put into it and a lot of work while pubg felt like an abandoned unpolished mess, apex legends hasn't had any decent or frequent updates since release so they're not much different than bluehole but at least apex legends is free.

No idea how it got the game of the year award but its a dam shame because it 100% doesn't deserve it, other games would have been way better off getting it, this game could be really fun and at it's core it could be a very good game but it's tragically been put into the wrong hands, fuck you bluehole with the passion if it was another company it could have been one of the best games out to date.",1556844745,1556844745,False,5,1,0.535018026828765869,0,True,False,False

My OTHER issue is youre intorduction to Loot creats that require keys to open, This is nothing but greedy, We already have to grind countless hour to obtain loot boxes, which have the worst drop rates ive ever seen, never obtained anything decent from 50+ boxes, but then you make the drop rate for the boxes with keys higher than all the others?? not to mention youve placed one terrible item in the key boxes and given it a drop rate of 98% I swear.

The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through. 

I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",1566260051,1566260051,False,3,0,0.534883737564086914,0,True,False,False

PUBG is an inferno of squandered opportunity, propelled by developer hubris and Chinese money. What started out as a promising game has degraded and fallen into increasing irrelevance. The game is plagued by huge amounts of downtime, lacklustre and unrewarding combat, and a punishing gear treadmill. What further ruins the experience are the aforementioned performance issues and rampant cheaters. Developer negligence to any of these issues has left the game stagnant, and superseded by games like CS:GO and Apex Legends. 

First and foremost the game is boring. One key issue that plagues PUBG is how huge the maps are, and how this creates a reliance on vehicles as there are no other transportation methods. In the standard 4 player mode it's common to find that you're unable to locate a vehicle that can transport all 4 players on your team, meaning 2 of you need to hoof it unless you can find a 2nd vehicle. 2-player vehicles just shouldn't be in the game, it adds to the huge amount of content-devoid downtime there is. 

_It is a very real possibility that you will never find a vehicle and you will be forced to sprint across huge open distances, in which nothing will happen._

When you're not looting, you're running or driving. It takes too long to get to a state where you're decently equipped. Equipment is _the_ ultimate decider in a firefight, not skill. A minimal amount of time per match is actually spent in combat with other players. Depending on luck, you might go through the majority of the match without firing a single shot, because you picked somewhere to go where the other players happened to ignore. This happens because, again, the maps are too large.

The developers are greedy and lazy, and unworthy of your support. Bluehole have the temerity to add loot boxes to an unfinished early access title. There are technical issues still prevalent in the game since PUBG appeared on Steam. It's a shame because PUBG could have been decent.",1550286233,1550337899,False,3,0,0.534693479537963867,2,True,False,False

Was a great game and good way to relax with friends after work; at first very minimal hacking was seen, maybe once every ten games, and less on FPP; but now its pretty much 50% of games (those of you saying you don't run into hackers probably dont have the ELO to be in games with them, or just assume that you're bad --- you're not as bad as you think.)

On EST if you play during daytime hours its ok; but who has a job and does that?

Going to have to give a thumbs down for one of the biggest disappointments for me this year. Game is completely unplayable because of the cheaters.

Will change my review if the hacking problem is corrected. 

My suggestions
-If you're not going to do a region lock, you need to at least do a ping/packet loss lock. That will at least cut some of the VPNs out. Honestly; I would probably do both. This wont solve the problem but it would cut it down a bit. 
-You need to examine the leader boards. People are not naturally getting 50% Headshot kills. 
-Get rid of microtransactions. A big reason there are so many hackers from China is because YOUVE MADE THIS A BUSINESS FOR THEM. They dont care about playing the game, they just want money from the loot crates. Hacking is an efficient way to do this; its their job. (A couple hundred bucks US a month in China likely would go a long way for some people). Not to mention that MTX are cancer and insulting to the user base anyway. 
-Improve the cheat detection in the first place (not sure if these devs have any control over this). 

Anyway; if something isn't done, game will slowly wither, and a true competitor will come out, and this will go the way of H1Z1 or others of its kind. 

And in my opinion; you'd deserve to lose your crown as ""the premiere battle royale shooter"" if you dont fix these issues. 

I will change the review if game is corrected later.

The times where stuff is happening (firefights, car chases, etc.) PUBG is extremely intense and adrenaline pumping.
The times where stuff is not happening (80%-90% of the match) It's monotonous and fucking boring.

As well as most the matches being painful uneventful slogs, the game is also very unpolished. At least once a game some sort of problem will arise, sometimes costing me the chicken dinner. I'd have to say the worst part of the whole match is the drop phase (In which you skydive from a plane and then parachute to the ground) I GARENTIE YOU that 7 times out of 10 you won't drop where you think your going to. Players that are good at dropping, are really just compensating for the bullshit. It's also telling that the mobile version runs better than both the Pc and Xbox One versions.

The gunplay is actually pretty good, with a verity of firearms and attachments (compounded with the rarity of the actual gunfights them self) each one is pretty unique and rewarding in there own way.

The graphics are murky and ugly as all fuck (on low) and even if you do have 2 Titan X's to run this game at ultra (This is pretty much the new Crisis, in those regarded) they still don't really look appealing (you play this game for the gameplay, and only the gameplay by the way).

The last thing I want to talk about is the developers. In terms of updates to PUBG the devs have only made very minor performance improvements to performance and almost nothing else (apart from that one time they added a map), then they add new skins and shit and expect the community to believe that there making huge progress with the game (there not). Each update only makes miniscule steps in the correct direction. They have a bunch of new stuff planned for 2018, but unless they fix the base game until, until then I struggle to want to support PUBG.

If you looking for short bursts of adrenalin, buy it. If you don't stay far the fuck away from this game. It's also overpriced for what it is (nearly £30). In high-sight I'd buy it for £16, £20 maximum. I'd say wait for a sale, but it never goes on sale and never will.

To fix this game all they need to do is:
-Fix the performance
-Fix the Drop Phase
-Fix the servers
-Fix the graphics
-Fix the amount of content included
-Fix the Price Tag

And then, and only then do you have a good video game.

This means, unless you speak mandarin, you will be severely limited in groups, as nobody will speak any English. Furthermore, because you don't speak mandarin, your team may decide to just kill you, for fun (this actually happened). It does not matter whether you select EU server, NA server, you cannot find a way to team up with people who speak actual English (obviously that was expecting too much on a EU/NA server).

I have played around 10+ group games now and no matter which server you pick the groups you are matched with are almost always entirely Chinese.

Despite their claims to be implementing anti-cheat measures, the amount of players running wallhacks (Seeing players through walls), aimbots, and no recoil hacks is absolutely absurd. 

Upon getting killed by a VERY obvious aimbot user (Killcam showed his camera snapping onto me through the cliffside multiple times) I went into the Replay section the game provides and viewed the replays for the last 20 games it has (It only keeps the most recent 20)

I was unable to find a single game in which there was not someone very, very obviously hacking within the replay. The most common hacks were wallhacks (Players would very obviously track other players through walls, to the point of managing to follow them halfway across the map without ever seeing them regardless of hiding places/changes in path/obstructions in line of sight/etc) and no recoil hacks (It was very common for people to just hold down the trigger and spray without their reticle ever even slightly leaving their target, regardless of gun used.) Behind these two, but still often enough, were aimbots, which were at least courteous enough to be really freaking obvious by just snapping their crosshairs to players as they look around and ""cycle"" through their potential targets. This occurs even if they have no line of sight to said target, mind.

But this game has MANY problems and downsides that i dont like. With the release of the new desert map i have played less because it is so shit. The loot spawns/drops are god awful and there are not that many small areas to drop unless you go way off to the side of the map. The map is based around sniping which i do like but goodluck playing it withouth a sniper and experience. With the map having big citties/towns it leaves just the good players and the lucky ones to win the first fire fight and the newer players and unlucky players to die withing the first 5 min. The map also has a very annoying glitch in when you first dorp to a location and try to pick up loot it will not go into your inventory, also you can not open doors or vault through windows. The old map is realy fun and i enjoy how even and spread out the loot is. There are fun places to drop like school, Mili, Prision and shelter. and small places to drop near the bottom half of the map. Another big issue with this game is that the lag and frame rate lag is extremely annoying. In the start of the match when every one is dropping in you can land and start rubber banding around trying to find a gun, or you can be unlucky and have your parachute glitch out and stand frozen in the middle of the air for 5-10 seconds. Frame rate drops are very common if you dont have a beast computer and wont often be that high, I my self have a gtx 1060 and only get 40-50 frames on very-low settings. The devs do not do very good optomization updates and i havent experienced any major changes in my framerate since the newest update. (12/30/27) Many people complain about hackers being a big issue where i have only experience 3 with my 432 hours played on NA and AS. The wrost i have experince is guys using wall hacks and aimbot which is not that hard to counter if you are playing squad. Overall i do love this game and will still play with my friends, but i do not think it is worth 30$ or worth getting if you have a crappy computer or no one to play with. Edit on (2/3/18) Game is still fucking ass and will not load me fast into matches, i am often loading in already in the plane or when the plane is halfway over the map already. Some times when i load in fast i have a glitch where i can only move faceing one direction and the only way to fix that is to restart the game. (3/23/18) game is filled with a lot of hackers and i dont see this game going any where. it was fun when i played and i had a lot of good moments. was worth 30$ but now i wouldnt pay anything more than 10, (7/4/18) I decided to play this game again and it still is shit but now i would say even worse, the menue is sarting to look like a shity mobile game surrounding your menue new skin releases and a new ""battle pass"". i have a gtx 1060 3gb and i7 7700k and this game still doesn not want to run smoothly on my pc, recently i have reset my computer because it was clutered and that didnt even help. Still no map selection and the guns they are adding are just reskins of the other guns and so far i have not found any map weapon exclusive guns even tho i havent played much so correct me if im wrong.",1514615096,1530723052,False,3,0,0.533188223838806152,0,True,False,False

I'm going to list some bullet points as to why I can't recomend the game, then elaborate a bit more.

-Game updates very slowly since launch
-Game launched in a poor state
-They refuse to region lock the game which causes so many issues
-The game has more hackers than any game I have ever played
-The new map is very flawed in so many ways
-Some guns have visual feedback while others don't
-There is little point to using any other gun besides a rifle or sniper rifle and MAYBE the lmg, the zone rarely closes in on areas that would give SMG and shot guns a chance.
-The game is poorly optimized 
-Because the game has lootboxes, it will always motivate people to cheat

I deicded to uninstall the game and I refuse to play it until the devs region lock china, or if their low priority queue actually helps (which I doubt, honestly, it doesn't help that much with dota 2)

Don't buy the game if you don't want to deal with hackers and people with 400 ping, it's just not a good experience, play fortnite battle royal, it's a far superior experience.

I have to turn almost everything in graphics settings to low or very low for the game to be playable.

I have to say that, to me personally, it feels more optimized after 1.0 release, so maybe it will get better over time.

Pros: addicting
Cons:
Damage Calculation - roll with a dice, in close range battles it doesnt really matter if you have 1-2 or 3 vest. sometimes shotguns kill you with 1 shot with vest, sometimes you need 3 hits without vest. Horrible Avarage server tickrate of 12 - many unrecognized shots. Desync makes you die behind walls. Sometimes enemies die 1-2 seconds after you shot.
Sound - not working at all, sometimes ghost-steps of people that are not even around 1km, footsteps of people walking in a building on open field with 0 buildings around. sometimes no sounds at all with enemys rushing right next to you. game cant handle more than 3 sound sources at once when you land in hotspots. play many games and you will have situations with people rushing you or running next to you without a single footstep.
Playerbase: 80% scared camping players, sometimes landing in hotspots, looting one gun, and start sitting behind doors, less to 0 players can be found outside. people driving from zone to zone to start camping in buildings over again
Loot distibution: horrible, 20 houses can give you no sights no vest, but landing in hotspots = roll with a dice again, maybe no gun, maybe no sound, maybe no damage calculation. you can choose between all these bugs, they will all happen to you, if you play some games.
Vehicle distribution: since the chance is so much higher, that the zones will NOT end on the edge of the map (simple geometry), you might think that you get more vehicle spawns at the edges / border / end of the maps. the places where vehicles are actually needed! but that seems be to complicated for the developer-team. Scouting with the parachute for vehicles is a pain in the a**, spawn timing is much to late.

Bad development, bad game, BUT microtransactions to make more money.
Useless loot like clothing to show you what you can buy for money!

If you want to play this game on a professional level you will soon realize that you dont really play against other people, most of the time you play against the game itself.

Pros :
-It's pretty
-Load-outs and gameplay are fun.

Cons : 
-Buggy
-No dedicated Server
-The more ping you have the higher advantage.
-Packet Loaders galore (People who intentionally increase their ping.)
-Hackers everywhere
-Your Loot boxes for playing are random : and usually end up being boxes you can't open without paying $$
-Distance Scaling is horribly off.
-Bullet Drop is nonsensical - and so is setting your sights.
-Some scopes defeat the purpose of sighting by purely disabling it.
-Guns are not balanced.
-Bluehole gives 0 f***s about their game.
-Bluehole will not improve their own game.
-Bluehole has the audacity to state that giving the players what they want is a non-realistic goal (Bull s***)
-No region lock : Chinese galore : which means ping advantage.
-Turning down graphics gives you an advantage over everyone (In particular viewing distance : because player models will load but terrain like grass and tree branches will not.
- ...

Pitifully, the cons go on and on. You could view it as pathetic even. A record breaking game in sales has, due to uncaring devs, unbeliable excuses, and astronomical spending to try to take Epic Games to court instead of spending that money to do what the players have asked for, made PUBG a steaming pile of s*** with no redeeming qualities. The fact PUBG is still showing up on the Featured & Recommended on Steam is laughable. A game would not get more than 50% negative reviews if it were not, in fact, trash.

I might come off as overly hostile but I just wanted to try to make this point as painfully clear as possible.

Stay away from this game and don't touch it with a 10ft pole. It's days are numbered.

Quick Edit : Setting sights is nonsensical not because it doesn't work (It does.) But because the system itself is flawed to begin with. Some scopes completely disable the ability to set your sights, meaning your x# scope will still have to aim up. A lot. That and the bullets don't arc -- they just fly straight and then drop like planes out of the sky.",1530834641,1531095866,False,5,0,0.532664120197296143,0,True,False,False

If you're just looking for some fun with friends, this is also one of the best games you might want to look at right now.

But greedyness has taken the best of it.

All the problems it has were once forgivable. But the game has been through being the most played game on Steam of all time, has been through it's official launch, and has even been played in major championships, and Bluehole refuses to address it's problems. It feels and plays like an early access game. And for a company that has made close to 10 figures that is inexcusable.

Since it's launch the content updates for us PC players have been few and very far between. It's mid june and all we've got this year is a new gun and right now a new gun and map. It's better than nothing but it's absolutely not enough for a game this big.

What you could not miss however was seeing the game being launched on another platform with even worse support than the one we have. And almost all the new content we've seen was in the form of in-game loot boxes for cosmetic items. At first the loot boxes were great, because you bought them with in-game money and could open them and maybe make some bucks on Steam. But they realized they could make more money by making us have to buy keys. And now they have realized they can make more money selling the box with real money.

Right now every player has a lot of ingame currency because it's been months since we've last got something to spend it on. And they just released a lot of cosmetics but literally all of it must be bought with money. And it's not a little bit of money, it's from 10 US dollars and up.

So, what we are seeing is this game turning into a putrid free to play model without it being a free to play game.

It's a fun game, but it's a time bomb. Right now even the people who really like this game for it's gameplay are getting sick of this bullshit.

随便乱封号
Without any reason or proof, they just banned my ID as they like
整个游戏的排行榜，就是个外挂排行榜。
The whole game ranking list is a Cheater leaderboard.
从我玩这个游戏开始就没开过外挂
I’m not the plug-in player, and I never use this cheating software since I started to play this game.
然而有一次跟好友在游戏中，突然掉线，
But,one time, I played with my friend in the game,my character suddenly dropped, 
我以为就是跟平时一样，只是一次普通的游戏报错,
I thought it was just a notice of normal game error as usual,
然而然后再上游戏却提示封号。
however, I want joined the game again,but prompted me I was banned.
卧槽，我的内心就像有千万匹草泥马奔腾而过。
What the fuck!I feel that there’re millions of alpacas galloping past my heart.
他们认为我是一个外挂使用者
They thought I was a Cheater.

而真相只有一个（真実はいつもひとつ）
2个赛季，我所有的游戏时间加起来接近500小时。900多局，我总共就吃了22次鸡，进入前10名的场次不到300次，场均杀人0.5，爆头率1%。而SOLO模式就吃过一场鸡。
这是外挂？
The truth is only one. For two seasons, I spent almost 500 hours to play this game, but I only won 22 times for over 900 games, and there’re less than 300 times that I can enter the top 10. Average killing 0.5 person per game, and HSP was 1%. Furthermore, I only played one time under SOLO mode, so does this means a cheater?

然后去我去官方论坛找客服，而客服只会Ctrl+C，Ctrl+V，不会给你解决实际问题。你叫官方给你一个封号的理由，官方只会避重就轻，不正面回答问题（论坛大部分官方的答复都是千篇一律）很明显的此地无银三百两，隔壁王二不曾偷——说白了，就是瞎鸡巴乱封号（宁可错杀3000，不可放过一人）
that,I went to the Official Forums to find Customer service for this matter.but the Customer service only use pre-prepared perfunctory rhetoric to you, not solve the actual problem,you claim Official give you a reason,Officials will only evade the 
importance of answering questions (most of the official replies of the forum are stereotyped)Obviously, there are no silver three hundred and two here, next door Wang II did not steal——Would rather mistakenly kill 3000, one can not let go.

而某些主播直播时开挂，自己做的洗白视频可谓是外挂锦集，官方对这些不闻不问。典型的只许州官放火，不许百姓点灯。
And some anchors open live when hanging, white wash their own video can be described as plug-in Kam sets,but officials do not bother with these. Only a typical state official set fire to the people, not people lighting!

而游戏内的环境也是被国人带坏。各种国骂。好好的一款游戏就这样被国人跟官方的不作为毁了。
The environment inside the game is also bad with some Chinese. Various countries curse.
A good game on the way so by the Chinese people with the official ruined.

不知道大家
是否还记得你捡到的第一把武器的场面吗？

Do you still remember the first time 98K picked up the scene?
Do you still remember the scene of the first three body equipment?
Do you still remember the excitement of eating chicken for the first time?

无数次的落地成盒，
无数次的死于跑毒，
而最后我是无数次的死于国人的外挂手上
最后，外挂还活着
而我却被封号！
Countless times landing into boxes,
Numerous deaths from running poison,
at the end, I died countless times in hand of Chinese plug-in players, and finally they are still alive and throughout the flight, but I was banned

现在我只想说,这98块人民币，我就当是喂狗了（小狗狗，我不是想侮辱你）
Now I just want to say,this 98 RMB, I should be feeding dogs (puppies, I do not want to 

insult you)

一个抄袭的游戏，抄的理所当然，还如此不作为，估计公司也蹦跶不了多久了。
作为一个来自中国的资深游戏设计者，为此游戏默哀三分钟（奏哀乐…）
国内代理是腾讯，但是蓝洞想过没有，腾讯真的是代理吗？中国玩家表示呵呵哒。
A plagiarism game, copied for granted, but also so omission, it is estimated that the 

company will not jump around for a long time.

sorrow ...)

agent? Chinese players said hehe.

It's just terrible and unstable. A decent rig isn't gonna cut it even with the graphical settings turned down. Hit box/detection leaves a lot to be desired and I'm sure many people can agree with me and attest to that. Matchmaking lately has been slow as it takes a while before you can actually start playing the game. All in all, PUBG could have had so much potential as a good battle royale game if the devs actually gave a damn about the community and just listened instead of being greedy. To me, it just feels like it's still on early access because of so many bugs and what not that it should not be considered a ""full game"". I will however recommend the mobile port, PUBG Mobile.

WIth over 400 hours in this game it is a statement i wished I'd never say, but the moment has come. For months I was an avid supporter of PUBG. I loved the realistic mechanics and its great graphics. I even loved it for all of its bugs and errors. 

But there comes a time when tiny lovable errors can ruin games and can even destroy a platform. PUBG has put no effort into obvservation and correction of bugs. The developers create new useless ideas without spending even days to perfect their previous thoughts. Even with massive community backlash on ideas and changes, PUBG staff never blink. 

I say why spend my money on a game that doesn't care about what I get in return. The reason fortnite has acceled where PUBG hasn't is care. They continuously ask players for their detailed thoughts and opinions on the game. You can be sure that if the community even remotely dislikes a game aspect, within 3 days it will be gone. The game even rewards players that spend nothing to play. If you choose to play for free, you will have no detriment to your gameplay. Only the asthetics.

For these reasons I have moved on to alternate Battle Royale games. To PUBG, I say goodbye.",1529970361,1529970361,False,2,0,0.531725227832794189,1,True,False,False

Mechanics and gameply are outstanding, but the game is unplayable.  Soon, a competitor will come along and do better than BH with their Battle Royale game, and PUBG will be desolate unless Blue Hole has the courage and drive to address these problems in their playerbase/community.

[i]usually[/i]


There are major problems with this game that are holding it back, and why games like Fortnite are more popular.

1. Servers and Regions
The servers are a lottery, sometimes you get a server that runs fantastically, or you get a server that lags and prevents you from moving with ""Network Lag Detected"" The regions are also an issue if you want to play duos or squads with random people, there is no regionlock.

2. Optimization
Even with every setting on very low, screen res at 70, and all the launch commands you could possibly think of, on a pc with I5-4430 and GTX 750 TI, The game stutters constantly, and the mouse input feels sloppy, due to the frames.

3. Development
These devs are awful at making a fun game, this is why Fortnite is becoming more popular, because those devs know how to make a [i]fun[/i] game. 


Overall:
If you have a ridiculously good PC, or don't care about low frames, this game is amazing when it works, when it doesn't work, the game is the worst BR game out there. PUBG doesn't hold a candle to Fortnite, with simpler graphics that run well to a wider audience, more fun features, etc. So in summary, if the devs get their shit together and start making the game better, this game would easily trump Fortnite, or H1, or The Darwin Project, but if the devs keep slacking, the game will become stagnant and dead. I mean, for fucks sake, we've had 10 updates since 1.0 Are you fucking serious? Since Jan 1st, Fortite has had like, 20+ updates.

Then you have the duo/squad runners in your solo games, these individuals are probably just as if not a little more disappointing than the hackers, they hold little regard for upholding the quality of the game (even if it has deteriorated quite severely over the years) Almost every solo game will have these people and it for many people who are genuinely playing the game to enjoy and get better at it, you will be infuriated when you watch these people working so close together in death cam's, whether it's for BP or easy wins, when you are killed by them, all you want to do is lean back, let out a sigh of frustration and wonder why you deal with it.

If you asked me to recommend the game, especially at this point i couldn't do it to anyone, a few years ago when i first got the game it really was a great amount of fun, it still had some polishing to do but overall it was great, i picked it up for $15 and at the time it was certainly worth the cash fork out, i very rarely dealt with hackers and very few times did i see duo/squads in solo, even being able to change region and join friends who were running matches in the US or the EU, it was pretty easy and didn't lag often at all, loading into the waiting lobby for a match was always super quick and that make the experience all the more fun.

Now, usually takes about 2 minutes to get into the waiting lobby, even had some matches where the loading screen continued way after the plane was already going, there was even one where i finally loaded in..to see my character underwater and watching as his health just dropped and i was out like a light, i don't know if it was due to network issues, maybe my computer is running more as a potato compared to it running as a high end PC when i first got the game, but some of the changes have put me off.

Before I get into the reasoning, let me clear this out: I am a fairly new player to PUBG PC. 

When I got this game on Steam Sale, I honestly kept my faith in the developers - after a couple of years, they must have fixed the game? and they did, but.... well, here we go:

PROS:
- The game runs and looks much better now (as compared to its initial launch)
- Matches are amazingly quick to find, almost less than 5 seconds for any game mode.
- Variety of map-styles, lots of players.

CONS:
- Even after all these 'tweaks' and upgrades, the game FEELS like it still needs to be developed, which is quite surprising considering how old it is. 
- Matches are quick to find, sure. But I don't speak Chinese/Mandrin and that's the biggest player base I come across. I can't even change the region so hey, its locked to SEA for me.
- Learning Curve is drastically horrifying, and this is coming from a person who has played Fortnite. 
- They may have added Mastery as a progression mechanic but I am genuinely not sure if it works, because I always lack the incentive to 'play another match'. 

So, why am I switching to the Lite version?
Simple - it takes much lesser space and is accessible to a lot of people (since its free to play) because of which I am not limited to playing people from the same region. 

I hope this company does a better job with LITE at least.",1561655742,1562689882,False,2,0,0.53125,0,True,False,False

It appears as though the bulk of Bluehole's energy is now poured into the inscrutable ""Season Pass"" cash-grab schemes. I understand that refocusing on die-hard, daily players is necessary to make development sustainable, but the reality is that they've created something wholly un-fun.

Literally every interaction feels fragile—

…from the horribly mechanical marketing around Events and Passes (there is zero incentive to participate in these as a casual player, partly thanks to difficulty and influence of randomness, and partly due to the thin allocation of rewards);

…to the confusing and disorganized menu/UI, which appears to have been engineered as an external, browser-based experience, with significant performance ramifications and issues with responsiveness, not to mention the chronically poor error messaging, a la ""Servers are too Busy,"" the woefully nonspecific alert which has been unchanged for the entire life of the game);

…to the in-game experience, which feels as though it's held together with masking tape, and is plagued with crashes, visual artifacts, bugs, client and network performance issues, hackers, and difficult or barely functional controls. Beyond ""janky,"" I can't think of a way to express the sesation of moving about in the world—the keyboard movement feels like scooting around a tub of water, and mouse movement is so harsh and choppy, it hurts my eyes. And this is just in a predictable, flat environment! If you get out into the world, virtually every building, rock, hillside, staircase, and trash pile seems to have been copy-pasted into the worlds without considering how a player will interact with it. There's no rhyme or reason to what you can vault over, what is climable, what speed you'll move when on a given pitch, what's solid or not, what makes good close-quarters combat, what's breakable, or what goes into a believable dwelling. The monotony of the maps suggests they could be just as easily be generated on-the-fly by an algorithm.

I don't often pick apart games like this... but having spent almost 300 hours in-game, I feel as though I've been swindled—tricked into trying to master (or just simply understand and enjoy) an experience which ultimately wasn't backed by a team with good intentions, priorities, or quality control.

This game is a technical nightmare, and for something that had e-sports and competitive play squarely in its sights, it was an unbelievable failure.

The game has numerous flaws including:
- Updates every day that do not fix anything noteworthy
- Consistent game crashes
- Frame rate problems even with decent P.C's
- the game costs $40 at launch ( Other titles free)
- Desync has never been addressed and most likely never will be
- Consistent Loot box drops in which require a paid Key ($2.50 or more) for most items worth a damn
- Weapon patches that ruin viabilty and spawn rates that make no sense at all
- Was released as a ""FULL"" game back in December 2017, with all of these issues, on Xbox One ( Mind you the P.C version is better, not having Xbox's frame cap at 30fps), Still just a cash grab for the holiday season, the greedy pricks.

Games luck and gambling at best.

Animations and movements are terrible (jumping looks like a low gravity hover)

Gathering loot is just not fluid at all;

FPS cam is too close to the ground and feels weird;

TPS cam is too high and just makes for terible wall peeking gameplay with campers;

Trying to shoot near walls ends up with your gun folding away and screwing you at the worst times;

THE RED BOMB ZONES!!!! lol why the hell are they even in the game its just so ppl with shit luck die for no reason and has nothing to do with skills at all! (GET RID OF THEM)

NET CODE !!!! OMG killed behind cover and missing a shot gun shot when your TWO inches away from the guy and all the rounds hit the wal RIGHT BEHIND HIM!

I will play fortnite over this anyday its butter smooth unlike this game, im glad he made his money because he deserves some money dont get me wrong but ppl need to move on from this game.

It's definatly not turnament ready, and will never be esports or anything like that.

I won't go into details but do your research before buying this now and the backstory to certain questionable additions to this game and you'll realise why it's getting so much hate. Now onto the review. 

I wanted to review this game from a long time ago but wanted to get quite a few more hours to expirence everything in finer detail to really get my opinion and if I really enjoy or hate this game. 

What PUBG does well is in graphics, enviroment and intensity of combat situations. Towns and cities that are marked feel lived in, like those places really went through a war and sometimes being left by yourself on the edge of Miramar or Erangal maps feels like almost a good fever dream (if there is one), so immersion is really good in this game. However the maps being so large and only 100 people means that ""Zones"" are implemented to force players together, anyone caught outside the zone slowly takes damage untill they go down. Zones get smaller  as the game goes on ect so you rarely have time to take in the sights. When in fire fights it feels intense bullet cracking past and callouts by compass direction and teamwork is really a highlight. Even in solo or Free for all the fights can be intense but the guns themselves well..

This is where it gets negative from here on out, Gunplay is janky. Sometimes guns will control how you want them to other times it feels like i'm shooting wet tissue paper at people. Physics are like a weird hybrid of a game thats wants to force CQB combat but want to be like ARMA making these weird scanerions of getting stuck on things you shouldn't and waiting for character to cancel animations while enemies are gunning you down, also animations for being near cover means I've seen enemy players and myself hunderds of times fire right into the railing or wall when peaking someone and alerting them. This game is meant to be played tactical but it rarely works once you get to the last few zones and even then it turns into who has zone first or high ground. Don't even get me started on the cars and bikes either, hitting invisible pot holes and bumps forcing you to loose health and take vehicle damage for something out of your control is dumb. 

Performance is all over the place, with 16gb ram a 1080gtx a i7 and this running on an SSD I rarely load in before friends with less powerful rigs and sometime I do. FPS is not constant and smokes just demloish Frames for anyone. You can see the constant threads of people having issues. 

Also Pacing in this game is not good. With dropping out of the plane and if you somehow make it to the last zones, this game shines in teamwork and intensity. Too bad the middle part which takes up a very very big chunk of game time is either getting a tacitcal spot, ""camping"" ,roaming the map on foot or by vehicle looking for people to yeet on or getting yeeted on. Sometimes you might get lucky other times it's just roaming a near empty map. 

Hackers is still a big thing. Constant 25mb updates which are suposedly for the cheat engine but I feel other wise show that the cheat engine they are using is not up to par with a game this size, VAC or Easy Anti Cheat should be used. Battle eye worked well in ARMA but a game with millions of players it's shown it can't hold up. It's also obvious hundereds of youtube videos in just a year and multiple run ins with people with no recoil M16's locked on head lets be real here. 

Also the devolpers, hmm lets think about this one hard. Introducing paid cosmetics and crates which we were told wouldn't be in the game and introduced way before the game was out of early access? Low drop rates and outrageous prices on the marketplace makes one think? Also the devolpers going full fine bros trying to hunt down others tackling the battle royale genre lets be real here? 

PUBG was an interesting idea. When new and if it was working it was fun and new, but updates to guns, not listening properly to the community, a game where bugs that were present since release are still there and constant additions of loot crates and micro transactions for skins and cosmetics that aren't even original in a game that isn't even finished?? 

I might continue to play on and off from time to time but the last update and 20 to 30 rounds I played really soiled the deal that this game is frustrating as hell and less rewarding even if you get a win. Even after getting multiple wins it never seals the deal with constant annoying bugs and just annoying combat. One thing I will give credit is this game is great for trolling enemy teams or players. Espically jihadi motorcycles but they have those in other games that work way better anyway? 

So what should be my final verdict? Don't buy it without research. Look at reviews, youtube videos, look at highlights from ""pro"" pubg players. Watch the bugs the downside make your own verdict? If your not sure if you should keep playing do the same thing! It's up to you to decide on your own merit. My opinion? I wouldn't buy it now. Fortnite is the bandwagon everyone is jumping on and way smoother and more energetic tho the cartoony style throws many off playing? If something simlair to PUBG shows up from a more experienced devolper with a solid goal on what they want and when they want to achieve and implement PUBG will been seen as sort of a should of could of didn't game.",1526278849,1526278849,False,3,0,0.531084239482879639,0,True,False,False
