I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.

PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.

The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.

PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.

I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.

PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem.
But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. 
The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.

Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.

Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.

And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content. 

In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.

Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",1570047110,1570056566,True,422,21,0.918850362300872803,0,True,False,False

Very Steady Developement and growing playerbase.
Probably one of the most successful early access games out there on steam.
Constant updates and bug fixes too!
Can be somewhat demanding for the pc depending on the settings used.
It's by far one of my favorite survival games. It has really come a long way.

Dear PLAYERUNKNOWN, I am writing to you from a distant cold north-western part of the Russian Federation, or, more simply, from the Republic of Karelia. My name is Andrey, I'm 22 years old. I became one of your big fans after playing in your modification to the game ArmA 3, I mean BattleRoyal (I apologize if I wrote the name of the mod slightly wrong, there like all the capital letters, but I unfortunately do not remember, played a very long time). Then I believed, and still believe that this is a breakthrough in the gaming industry, a regime where hundreds of players are released to the open terrain, where they have to kill each other with what they find in this locality. And this mode is called Battle Royal, it's cool, isn't?
Thanks to you, I decided to learn more about the setting of the Battle of the King: I watched two parts of the film of the same name, and all sorts of trash American films, like ""The Condemned"" and ""The Hunger Games"", read a couple of books where deytvie occurs in a similar genre, in general, was not boring. I learned a lot of things about survival in different conditions. Maybe someday it will come in handy, but I hope not. Thanks for this.
And now, perhaps, I will go to the root of the problem, because of what I'm just writing this review. Rather, when you were an ordinary mod designer, I would not write about it. But now you have a serious company, and on the sales of this wonderful game you earned, I'm sure a lot of money. So, buy more servers, and if possible, put them in Russia.  I put the search game, waited 10 minutes, got angry, went to the grocery store for an hour, came back, and, wait for it, the game is still being looked for! How i must understand this?! I spent 1/20 of my salary on your game, but I can not play it, because you see, it's not looking for a game. And yet it is badly optimized: in main menu at the low graphics settings I have a slide show. Correct, please.
I hope you will see this appeal to you, or I will have to return my money, sorry.

In fact, this is the first review I have posted on steam. I'm writting this at 1:15 am for some reason but whatever. I just want to give my opinion on the game as of 1-13-2018. I was very suprised to see that this game has such mixed reviews. Anyway, enough about me; let's get on with the review! 

Pros: (Stuff I like about it)
Fun to play with friends
Great for strategy lovers (Feels like you are really in the hunger games)
Getting a kill is very exiting
Great graphics
Very realistic gameplay
Loading time between each game is very short
Veriety of ways to play
If you die in this game, it's like ""eh, no biggy, on to the next game!"" (Doesn't make me mad easily)
There are a few more I can't think of right now. 

Something to understand:
Alot of waiting. (Depends on playstyle) If you are not a god at fps games, you will probably end up waiting alot and hiding. Most people want to go to areas with lots of people and just play like it's Call of Duty Deathmatch or something. Unless you are like in the top 1% of ffps players, you will die going into big cities and trying to kill everyone. I bought this game expected more shooting and killing, but going guns blazing into a crowded city is not how you win this game. That's not a bad thing as it turns out. I have had loads of fun playing this game, but in a strategic sense. I found that most of the fun I would get out of the game came once you get to be one of the last 10-15 people alive. That's when it gets really intense. My heart starts pounding and my hands start shaking. But up until that point, you mostly are going to be just going through houses and looting for better gear. 

TLDR; Beginning of game is a little boring, middle of the game is ok/good(30-20 people left), end of the game(~10 people left) is amazing and where pubg shines.

Cons:(Stuff I don't like)
Rng can screw you over. Where the circles are is RNG. What weapons you find is RNG. The vehicle spawns are random (mostly) Sometimes you will just get screwed by RNG and can't do anything about it.  
Vehicle phisics are still kinda broken (Look up pubg fails on youtube, half of the ""fails"" will be vehicle glitches
Players can be toxic (squads)
Some game mechanics are not explained when you first start playing. e.g pressing b will change firing modes, ctrl 1,2,3,4 changes vehicle seats, right clicking invintory will make it change slots instantly.

It's getting late so I'm going to wrap this up:

Overall I have really enjoyed this game. I would recommend it to people who enjoy strategy and tactical thinking. It's a great game to play with friends and have a good time. If you like realism in games, this game is for you. The amount of control you have over your character is amazing. If you like the hunger games or ever wanted to feel like you were in it, definetly check this game out. I think that for its price (about half of AAA games like Call of Duty) this game is worth if you like strategy and some fps mixed in. I would give this game a 8/10. Would buy again. 

Anyway sorry for any mistakes in this review, I have no prior experience writing reviews so this one might be a little, uh, ""meh"" Hope this helped and if you ever want someone to play with, hit me up :D Ok good night and good luck in Player Unkown's Battlegrounds!

So, I'm over a thousand hours in and I'm stepping away from PUBG for a hiatus. I'm not sure I'll ever be back.

While playing this game I've experienced wonder and elation from the emergent moments. Getting kills or winning games in this pioneer of the Battle Royale genre are unlike anything else in gaming. You can ride the high of a single win for days. I have routinely played with a squad where winning two or three games in a row isn't uncommon. You feel like a god among mortals.

But for every one of those highs there were between 10 and 50 moments of frustration, incredulity, and rage.

This game constantly violates a personally held intense desire for [b]fairness[/b]. And yes, it's on me to regulate my emotional response to a video game. But this game's RNG (circle position and loot distribution) can so directly dictate your percentage-chance of winning a game, it has the same psychological and physiological effects as a losing streak when gambling.

You sit down at the table and place your bet. You've already lost a dozen hands in a row, so your brain tricks you into thinking you're ""due"" for a win. You're dealt two 10s. You split. You're dealt a 9 and a king. Your sympathetic nervous system is in overdrive. You're certain now to win, so your dopamine receptors are primed for a hit. Adrenaline is being fed into your body. Then the dealer flips over their blackjack.

You've been playing PUBG all evening, but you've mostly been playing walking simulator or getting killed early without a gun in your hands. You queue for game, and you drop into North Georgopol with your buddies. No one else is there. You walk out of your first building with your ideal kit, 2/2/2, two first aids and some boosts. And then you see the circle has centered on Novo.

When you don't win, there's a negative fallout because you don't get the dopamine hit you were expecting, so you feel bad [i]physically[/i] - you get that sinking feeling in your stomach, your blood pressure drops precipitously from the high it was at just a moment ago.

The problem is when I feel the loss was unfair, whether because of RNG or shitty netcode/desync, there's a compounding effect. I start to feel the game is working actively against me and in favor of other players. I know this is illogical and is actually not the case. However, when I walk out of the two high tier loot buildings outside of Power Grid on Miramar with a shotgun, a Win94, and no armor and then the redzone centers on me, it's hard not to feel like RN-Jesus doesn't have a vendetta. Or when the bullet that downs me registers when on my screen I'm in a bathroom with no windows and no line of sight to the enemy.

Feel free to tell me to git gud. I know I'm not great at this game. I'm in my thirties, and the last shooter I played seriously was CoD4:MW ten years ago. I'm not carrying anyone to victory, despite occasional flashes of brilliance.

Regardless, the game's persistent issues, and Bluehole's unwillingness or inability to fix them have left me unable to continue playing it. And what's sad is there will likely never be another game like it, since every BR game released since has lacked the military realism and emphasis on strategy and smart positioning that make PUBG so compelling to me.

Ultimately, perhaps if you're better at controlling your emotions than I am, you will continue to relish the victories when the circle falls in your favor, and you get the drop on that last squad or duo. For now, it's just time for me to take a break.",1553450125,1553450516,True,65,6,0.787531077861785889,0,True,False,False

I can say having paid for a few keys and the pre-release game that for the $30-$50 that this game has cost me, I have gotten my moneys worth.  Over a year of solid online play has been had with friends in squads and thats definitely a shit-ton of time.  

The issues suggested by others are many:
1) Region blocking due to cheats
2) Cheat protection was poor
3) Network Latency/deseync is high and still a problem
4) New content has been very slow to release, maps, guns, etc
5) Poor release schedule on updates, almost always ran long
6) Game seems to have become a skin-engine (like Counter Strike)
7) Map glitches causing damage/movement issues

Some of those issues are with the company and some with the gamer design. Here's the fundamental goods about the game.
1) Methodical paced games.
2) Solid gun play feel and weight
3) Great positional audio/sound work 
4) Enjoyable coop feel for a small team
6) 3 large/well placed maps.
7) Decent transport system

Overall I'd say this game when played with a good group of well intentioned fun seekers is still  a fun game.  Part of the original fun was in the jank from the game and as BlueHole has tried to push this game into a more polished and e-sports-capable state, it has suffered some with the crowd due to the ridiculous nature of deaths and general fun/sillyness dropping away.   At this point the game has large flaws, map issues with odd placement of momentum stopping dips, vehicle oddness in movement code, general desync between players engagements, and some basic problems with region protection and cheater prevention.  

It is still however fun with a good group of people.  Is it worth the price now?  I don't know, but I will say that it was for me and I've enjoyed my time with this game.   Will I continue to play?  Probably because its still relatively enjoyable with the right friends.   However I will likely move on eventually to another more polished game due to the slow release and often poorly defined release cycle of the developers game updates.  I think it is getting better, but I'm not sure if the future holds any meaningful updates for this game.

It had very negative reviews which usually would have driven me away but I decided to give it a chance due to a friends recommendation. 

This is a really good game. It has an excellent selection of weapons that each both feel good and unique to shoot while being balanced. The game pacing is good and the excitement in combat, especially in the late game is unmatched and keeps me coming for more.

[i]Note: I play exlusively on EU servers and over 90% of games are FPP.[/i]

[h1]Many of the commonly reported issues are valid.[/h1]
[list]
[*]Desync is a significant issue that can be frustrating at times but the devs seem to have sent out a patch recently that mitigated those issues significantly. 
[*]I have never encountered a person that was defninitely hacking but some that might have been.
[*]The loot system is awful, Getting mostly timed items and the occasional permanent one is definitely on the scummier side of the 2018 microtransaction landscape.
[*]The loot system is garbage, randomly getting a paywalled crate for your effort is a horrible anti-reward.
[*]The movement sometimes feels a bit clumsy, like it's working against you.
[*]Some objects unintuitively block shots/grenade damage
[*]Performance is commonly poor when a lot of players are concentrated in a small area.
[/list]

There are some other minor issues which add up with this list to a less than ideal experience. I Really don't like microtransactions but this one doesn't bother me, probably because I truly don't care if I look like harley quin or a stereotypical clown. I understand that it bothers people but it does not warrant the current Mostly negative rating. 

Even with its issues I find the game extremely fun and I either learn to deal with the issues or they cause minor frustration, depending on their nature.

This is the highest amount of fun i had for 30$ i spent on anything in life, game is better played in Duo/Squad because some solo tend to be lonely and a bit boring when you don't have any action for 20 minutes.

For all the new players, this isn't an easy game, if you think you can win and master this game after 20 hours please don't bother buying it and start nagging in the reviews/forums/reddit, you need a huge amount of playtime and patience to become decent and learn the mechanics.

Devs need to focus on what is important to move this game to another level, especially if they want it to become an eSport game, which i don't see happening at the same scale they had in mind and not just because of the bugs in the game but the actual luck involved in each match (random weapons, armor, circle).",1552778862,1554491399,True,66,3,0.666233360767364502,17,True,False,False

There is a major problem with hackers and cheaters ruining games and the loot boxes aren't that fruitful usually. Prior to the vaulting update mobility can be challenged by a simple fence reaching up to your knees.

With those out of the way I can honestly say this game is 100% a fantastic choice for anyone looking for great team-based game play that has a focus not just on run-and-gun quake style killing but really making tactical choices. That is the key that separates this game so distinctly from other Battle Royal style games, like FN. More on FN later. The weapon attachments, vehicle choices, movement (crawl for safety, rush to the zone or loot more and risk taking damage?) and distinct style of each gun really lets you set up for certain styles of game play. I'm the mid-low range guy in our group that prefers shorter range combat like shotguns, for instance. 

The que in this game is nonexistent. It's amazing how fast you'll get pulled into a game, full team or solo. It almost trivializes death- ""Oh I got so far only to get plucked by a lucky shot. Ah well."" *instant reque*. It goes a lot to reduce frustration when you can just jump from one game to another, while at the same time keeping the game intense when scrapping for gear or getting to that final circle. 

As far as Fortnite goes, I hear the two games compared quite a bit and, every time, always have to bring up the fact that game modes do not mean game styles. FN completely lacks the tactical edge and accuracy of PUBG- your guns don't have nearly the level of customization, you have to deal with quality of loot and your accuracy with most guns is fairly poor. Use of cover is discouraged in a lot of places because most all cover is -destructible-. You can build cover and walkways and such in that game, adding a very interesting aspect that PUBG lacks, but doesn't do much to change how the game is played- in a much more run-and-gun fashion. 

Overall, I would suggest this game to people who are looking for quick, intense games that don't require a permanent investment. You won't find any levels, bonuses or any gimmicks like that here. Team play gives so much more of a fun experience as well.

+ Solid battle royale gameplay. Drop from a plane, collect loot, kill players, get pushed in closer and closer, try to be the last man standing.  The gun play is pretty realistic, and it's always fun to get into an intense firefight.
+ Great fun with friends
+ Very High Replayability
+ First Person and Third Person modes.
+ Vehicles 
+ Depening on how well you do, you earn battle points. You can use these to get crates which you can sell on the market for profit OR open them for a cosmetic item. 

~ More of a personal note: When playing in a squad it's very common for one of your friends to get knocked down, and within a second they get killed with no chance of reviving them. This causes you to either leave the game or your friends have to sit there in boredom watching you play the remainder of the game.

- Can be frustratingly repetitive. Example: Spending 20minutes looting / looking for players and then suddenly getting sniped across the map.
- Not enough map variety (there are only two maps currently)
- Lots of bugs... from randomly flipping off a bike, taking heavy damage parachuting from the plane, glitching inside loading buildings, etc.

Before buying pubg, I added and removed it from my wishlist several times. Then I came to a decision, I thought why not give it a try. Besides, refund option is always there.
Now after playing 105 hours, I am writing this review. So u know that I haven't refunded it yet. This game is worth every penny. Don't know why people compare it with Fortnite Battle Royale. That's so lame. pubg is in early access, so it has some bugs, no need to create chaos for that.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]

Gameplay is realistic, No respawn. Just 1 life. That's what makes the game challenging.

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]

Overall graphics is good, as an early access game it has some optimization issue and bugs. That's not a big deal, it will be fixed when the full version will be released.

[h1]Movement/Character:[/h1]

You can customize your character when you first play the game. You can play as both First_person and 3rd_person.

[h1]Playerbase:[/h1]

Pubg was released this year (Early access). The developers didn't know that it will be on the top crossing Dota 2 and CSGO.

[h1]Money_earning_system?:[/h1]

There are two types of crates. Survivor and wanderer. Price of survivor crates is higher than wanderer, around 0.80. When u play each match u get BP-Battlepoints which u can spend to get these crates. There is also a special crate which is available for a limited time. That is Gamescom Crate, it needs a key to open which costs $3. If u are lucky enough you can get a rare item.(It's all about luck) believe it or not ,i have earned more than around $45 

[h1]Overall:[h1]

Pubg is an early access game. The last version of the game will be much better, besides, new Desert map and weapons, vehicles are also coming.
Don't care what other gamers say, few gamers in my friendlist wrote negative reviews about this game without even playing for 5min. It's because their config can't run this game/

I highly recommend this game. You will get a nice feeling when you play it with your buddies. Addictive Game.

NEW MAP
So Sanhok is out and I have to say it's a breath of fresh air to play. I really like this map and I hope all future maps can deliver similarily to this one. I'll list what I consider to be the good things about it.

1. More trees/foliage and the level design makes it less likely for you to be randomly sniped running across the map because there is more cover and blind spots. 

2. Loot districbution is massively improved. in the 15 or so games on the new map I have played I have not once had a problem with no finding a weapon at the start resulting in my death. There is an abundance of ARs and ammo and I don't think I have even had to pick up a pistol except for 1 match. 

3. Faster matches, more action. Naturally being a smaller map this was bound to happen. The blue electric field is still dangerous but its easier to get from circle to circle even with less time between them. Most matches finish in 20-25 minutes.

-----------------------------------------------------------

99% of mic users in this game are ridiculously annoying. Thankfully there is an audio option to mute everyone but team members. However... if you decide to listen to all the random chatter you can experience great moments like having a dance off with people to the Backstreet Boys while waiting for the match to start or having people play sad music (Hello, Darkness my old friend...) when you kill them. I even had a guy apologize to me for killing me in the most sincere voice.

Get some friends, play as a team, have some fun. Queueing up for a random team is likely to end in disappointment as your teammate will usually be one of 2 types of people. 1. He does not speak your language and is constantly yelling at you in his native tongue and making strange screaming sounds. 2. He dooesn't talk at all. Both of these ruin the team aspect of the game. This doesn't mean it's impossible to get a good random team but as usual friends are your best bet.

I think much of the negative reviews and hate is overblown. The game is certainly not perfect but it is an addictive experience with good gameplay and concept executed fairly well. I am looking forward to the game to have continued support and new content added..

[u]The Usual Complaints[/u]

-Cheating. There is some definite cheating that has ended promising matches for me and for my team. However, the majority of my games DO NOT end because of cheaters. 

-Lag/Server Issues. 6 months ago there was some definete issues. As of now I very rarely have any sort of noticeable server lag and it's mostly because I play on servers with my friends from other parts of the world. The main server issue revolves around people complaining about the low tick rate and desync. That is definetely a valid complaint but it's still overblown.

-Performance. While I have no issue running the game several of my friends do. You don't need an AMAZING PC to play it but you do need a fairly good rig. I think a lot of people try to play with specs far below the recommended and then are upset they aren't playing at 60fps with no frame drops.",1514221388,1529975009,True,31,6,0.63241124153137207,0,True,False,False

lag
guns skins ( explained why )

needs a decent pc to run , probs had to spend 600 + minimum on a gaming pc , mine cost around 500/550 and i run at like 35-50 which is playable .

Overall this game is decent , I bought it 13 months ago ( August 2017 ) and I played it with friends every day for almost 6 months , then we just stopped for another 6 months and got back into it around 2 ""ish"" weeks ago , the main downisde of this game for me is the developers and the optimization , for the simple reason that it's just badly optimized , and now the developers are only interested in making money for example adding gun skins when bugs need to be fixed and upping the price of crate keys , and also one thing that's annoying but the developers can't really help is that every time me and my duo/squad gets into a gunsfight , within 30 seconds of the first shots being fired another team will roll up behind us and attack us , it's like unintentional and indirect teaming , but it's just annyong so that's why we don't fire upon sight on people unless neccessary , because it just happens every single time so there's no point , and bare in mind this is like in a decent sized circle so people should be spread but we are always getting attacked by two and sometimes even 3 teams at once and just get screwed over by it to be honest ,it's a hard one for me to review as I am quite confilcted on what to think/say , but finally , this game is decent , I would buy it as it's a good laugh with friends but I wouldn't if you don't have anyone to play with as it'll get boring within 10 hours of gameplay !",1536440443,1536440443,True,15,0,0.627102911472320557,0,True,False,False

-Decent game and the gameplay is better than other Battle Royal games out there (IMO)
-Supports Ultrawide (21:9)

As of late it also seems like pubg is really caring, adding and removing stuff that the community does and doesn't like, the training mode for example. I also see people saying ""why are they adding skins instead of fixing the game"" which is plainly dumb. The engineers working on server side performance and the game itself are not taking their time to add skins. Another team takes care of that. So should you buy PUBG? Well, I'd say there's currently no other game like it right now, i really enjoy the gunplay and overall feel of the game(especially when it works) and I am able to overlook the bugs and de-sync from time to time.

PUBG's technical shortcomings can undermine its broader achievements on rare occasions, but they don't override your desire to continue playing. Each phase of a match presents a different type of tension that is equal parts thrilling and terrifying, driven by the insatiable desire to be the last person (or squad) standing. Whether you play solo or in a group, successfully executing adaptive tactics to win intense, high-stakes firefights makes for an incredibly rewarding experience. Every player has unique stories of their most memorable matches, and even after hundreds of hours, PUBG continues to inspire rousing tales of victory and defeat.

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds has taken the military-sim gameplay popularized by games like ARMA and DayZ, boiled it down to its most exciting parts, and streamlined it into quick and accessible rounds of pure, hassle-free, survival-based action.

P.S. Vikendi, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds' new snow map, has left the test servers and is now live for everyone to skid around in on their snowmobiles. 

Along with the new map, there’s the new pass. The Survivor Pass can be levelled up by completing missions, netting yourself new items and skins. It’s free for everyone, but you'll need to spend cash to get the best stuff. The Premium Survivor Pass will set you back $10 and includes over 60(permanent) skins and emotes.",1545303251,1545310053,True,80,14,0.61444169282913208,5,True,False,False

The game is really immersive when it comes to intense situatons, such as 1v1's or when you are in a fight against another player or squad. Over time you may come across funny moments or times when you may be confused on why the player you headshot 4 times did not die. The game is alot more fun with friends too, so that is what i reccomend doing. The gameplay overall is very good and it is something that i think everyone should experience. 

[h1][b]Graphics[/b][/h1]
Now we get onto the Graphics of the game. I play on Ultra settings when im on PUBG, but in order to get be fair, i will write my review with my experience on the graphic settings on Medium. The player models look great and the lines/polygons look very smooth. The render distance is pretty far when i jump off the plane, i can see most of the buildings below me, now the render distance may be different between me and you because of our specs, i use a GTX1060 6GB. The Dessert maps oof PUBG don't look as good as the Grass Map's, when i had first seen the dessert map, i thought i was playing on Low Settings, i was actually on Ultra. Overall, the graphics look great on ultra, and pretty good on Medium. Playing on Low still gives a good experience.

[h1][b]Development[/b][/h1]
I am happy to see that the PC 1.0 has been released, and has fixed lots of the problems i thought they would nevr fix before. I used to throw lots of hate to this game because of how poorly developed i thought it would be. But boy was i wrong, it is great to see that the game optimizaion is now better, now the lag is also reduced (still needs to improve a bit more though). The graphics have also been improved. Overall, the game is being developed slowly but with major changes to the game.

[h1][b]Community[/b][/h1]
Now, there are lots of players complaining about the chinese hackers and how disruptive other players may be. I have also experienced this. But not all chinese players are bad though. I cannot deny on how many toxic and salty players there are in the game, but if you do come across one though, there is always the option the report the player. Aside from the chinese hackers, PUBG has a lovely community on Twitch, Youtube, and etc. With lots of content being put out and streamers to watch.

[h1][b]Summary[/b][/h1]
PUBG is selling tons of copies every day, and the player base of the game is outstanding! The game has the most viewers on Twitch, with more streamers now playing the game. There are not much signs of the game dying, and we must hope that the developers put effort on the development of the game. Overall, even if you don't really like the game that much, try it atleast. But i warn you, this game is addicting to some people so be aware!",1514686428,1514686653,True,6,0,0.610205531120300293,0,True,False,False

I so like this game because for years never made it out of game I played a lot survival game and battle royale.
The concept of this game not new but without a doubt better than h1z1 kotk (king of the kill) and better the culing and let's not mention Fortnite imitation.
The game allows you to feel like you are literally in the war field and all you need to do is survive (very noticeable when you play squad)

[h1] Why i think that this game is the best [/h1]

[b] Graphics [/b] - Very good for today's time and it seems that the developers also improve it more. 9/10

[b] Gameplay [/b] - Feel good and true and every moment you are in the game is not allowed to breathe for a very challenging and dangerous moment throughout the game. 9/10

[b] Strategy [/b] - The game requires thinking and understanding. 10/10

[b] Skills [/b] - In this game you have to have skill from survival games and royal battel you can also purchase skills from the game. 9/10

[b] Aim [/b] - The aim in this game is a bit different and requires more thinking, in this game are attached to aim some features such as shooting distance and mods of the gun (auto, single and burst) You still need skills of aim from cs go for example. 10/10

[b] Difficulty [/b] - The game is very challenging and it is not easy to get a chicken dinner
Very challenging at top 10 and requires a lot of concentration. 10/10

[b] Computer specification [/b] - In order to run this game on a good graphics needs a good specification but the creators of the game are not disappointing and allow even those who do not have a very powerful computer specification to play on low. 8/10

[b] Price [/b] - The price in my opinion is worth the performance and even a little cheap I would give a game like this $ 40 its price is equal and easily can spend about 1000 hours. 10/10

[b] Solo due squad ? [/b] - The game offers three game modes with friends or alone which increases the enjoyment. 10/10

[b] Maps [/b] - The game currently shows us 2 types of maps each showing different guns and different vehicles and challenges , It also seems that later there will be more different types of maps. 9/10

[b] Nature states [/b] - There are currently 3 natural modes in the game (Arpel, Rain and Sunny). Each natural situation affects the course of the game differently and challenges in a different way. 10/10

[b] Ratio of developers to fans [/b] - It seems that developers every day work hard on the game and improve it and seem to care about the requests of the fans and their opinion compared to many other games like cod and dayz. 10/10

[b] Cheaters [/b] - The game has no slackers but it seems that the developers do not keep silent and reduce the scammers whether it is with the report button or if it is using the new death cam that allows you to see if the person who killed you was an aim bot or other cheating. 8/10

[b] Bugs ? lugs ? [/b] - The servers rarely have too many lugs but still have to be improved. 7/10


In conclusion, I hope that Bluehole (developer of the playerunknown's battlegrounds) will continue to listen to customers and will continue to develop the game and invest. In addition to this I also hope that Bluehole will allow competitions games like esport  Thank you very much for the awesome game My opinion 8/10 has more to improve!

However the game must be optimised to work fluently for the game to actually to function at the level that the fanbase wants it to, rather than add maps when the game is not fully ready to even consider adding more content such as new weapons and new maps. I feel as if this game is only big due to it being the first game in its genre to make it big and this is how they have been able to stay as popular as they are. I have played many other games like this such as Fortnite: Battle Royale and the IOS and PC version of Rules of Survival and have found that these games are more optimised even though they do not have the same amount of funding that PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS have.

It's totally a unique game to me. I really want to thanks the [b]developers[/b] for thinking of such a new pattern of gaming genre. I'm listing some of the things I liked about this game...

[+] Playing solo is enjoyable as well.
[+] Takes a very little time for matchmaking.
[+] Gameplay is solid, realistic and enjoyable.
[+] Developers working to keep fair play environment all the time.
[+] Weather sync is amazing!

Ingredients
- To Make the Dough
375 grams (3 cups) plain flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil
1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water
Extra flour for dusting 


- To Make Cheese Filling
15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese
5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)
Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper


- Extras
Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)
Parmesan cheese
Basil
Fried vegetables
Shrimp
Fish slices
Chicken pieces 
Make the Ravioli filling.
cinnamon

- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.
- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.
- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

Make the Ravioli dough.

- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.
- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.
- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.
- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.
- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.
- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).
- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. 

Fill the Ravioli shells.

- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.
- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.
- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.
- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.
- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. 

Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.

- Roll the dough into two sheets
- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.
- Fill with the ravioli mixture.
- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.
- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.

Cook the Ravioli.

- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.
- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.
- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest 
- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates

Serve it up.
Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy",1520889812,1520889812,True,5,5,0.587813615798950195,3,True,False,False

Player Unknown's Battlegrounds has been blowing up lately. Breaking records on steam while still being in Early Access.

Now let's start with the core gameplay of PUBG. You drop out of a plane on a large island with 99 other people. While looting the island and all its buildings you'll be forced to stay within a certain area called the Player Zone. The Player Zone get's smaller and smaller during the game. Since loot is spawned randomly games will have a certain factor of ""luck"". 

The graphics in PUBG look great if everything is maxed out and the map is 8x8km which is rather big. However unfortunately the map is pretty boring. While roaming the island and looting your way through it, you'll come across loads of attachments. These make looting a lot more interesting. Now you have a reason to keep looting once you have a gun, armor and some medical supplies. Deciding what place to go next takes a bit of strategical planning, would it already be looted? Where will the player zone move to? Do I use the car or do I go walking so they won't hear me? Etc.

Player Unknown's Battleground is rather buggy. The game doesn't have the best optimization and has a lot of buys/flaws. You can't climb/vault at all, putting your gun to a window and peaking doesn't work great and loads of other small bugs. Now don't get me wrong, the game does get updated and new weapons get added from time to time, but they honestly should focus on fixing the bugs a bit more.

Now why is Player Unknown's Battlegrounds receiving so much negative attention? It's due to a couple of reasons. First of all, the bigger your game gets the more people you get that dislike it of course. Second of all, the developers broke a couple of promises. They've promised us there would be no micro transactions during Early access, yet here they are. They've delayed the vaulting update 3 times now, they're calling out and threatening other Battle Royale games for copying PUBG, banning people who kill streamers with the reason ""stream sniping"" & they're not really fast on fixing updates and bringing out new content. 

Does this mean Player Unknown's Battleground is a bad game? No. In fact it's a great game, and although it's a bit boring if you play solo, the game is great and one of the better Battle Royale games out there at the moment. It's a blast with friends and before you know, you have been playing for hours. Looting until your loadout is perfect and sneaking up on players is really fun and killing enemy's is satisfying for sure.

Overall, if you're looking for a good Battle Royale game, Player Unknown is a great option. Just be sure you like the slow paced gameplay. If you're not entirely sure if PUBG is something for you I can highly suggest free variants like Fortnite.",1512804884,1512804884,True,5,0,0.587684094905853271,0,True,False,False

Inspired by Kinji Fukasaku’s 2000 movie, a Battle Royale game sees a large number of players thrown into a single area – in PUBG’s case, 100 – where they battle it out until only one survives. To improve their chances they can scavenge for weapons, weapon modifications, body armour and ammo, all of which give them some hope of not dying within the first seconds of a gunfight.

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds has taken the military-sim gameplay popularized by games like ARMA and DayZ, boiled it down to its most exciting parts, and streamlined it into quick and accessible rounds of pure, hassle-free, survival-based action. Even though each game starts the same way, its remarkable ability to feel like a new, tense adventure each and every round has kept me coming back for hours on end.

While PUBG focuses on executing the core mechanics that make battle royale-like games great, it lacks technical refinement. At launch, PUBG is noticeably improved from its early access days, but frame rates can still fluctuate inexplicably. Even a high-end PC can have trouble maintaining a consistent framerate with relatively modest graphics settings, evidence of PUBG's ongoing optimization struggles.

PUBG's technical shortcomings can undermine its broader achievements on rare occasions, but they don't override your desire to continue playing. Each phase of a match presents a different type of tension that is equal parts thrilling and terrifying, driven by the insatiable desire to be the last person (or squad) standing. Whether you play solo or in a group, successfully executing adaptive tactics to win intense, high-stakes firefights makes for an incredibly rewarding experience. Every player has unique stories of their most memorable matches, and even after hundreds of hours, PUBG continues to inspire rousing tales of victory and defeat.

 Postive
 
 +The high-stakes nature of combat makes enemy engagement a constant thrill
 +Emergent tactical situations whether you play solo, in a duo, or with a full squad
 +Intrinsically rewarding; strong sense of accomplishment
 +Unpredictable variables make each match feel unique
 Negative 

 -Technical problems (crashes, glitches) can ruin a good match
 -No in-game guides or tutorials
 -Unpredictable performance hits, even on high-end hardware

This is just my opinion, so far. The game has a great community base and dev team that truly care about the game. The somewhat realistic game play brings you in and keeps you playing all night without any regrets. The guns even though I'm no gun expert are amazing in my opinion with a large choice of guns and attachments with my personal favorites being the M16 and P9c. The driving is touchy, but feels fine after 3 hours of playing and of playing and flips on the bike are great, but the worst thing would be driving and the slightest change in the land stops the car and you take damage from hitting a 2 inch incline. The spawn area is a massive rant about who is the real china number 1. Graphics are fine in my opinion nothing too special but they are done well. But the thing that really makes this game is playing with friends the shenanigans people get into from killing each other with pans and running each other over in a death fight of the cars; It's truly amazing how much this game has made me laugh and cry.I don't have too many complaints with the game other than the serves the game runs on can't support an overflow of players and the game being the most popular game out I feel like this is a thing that needs to be fixed fast, the lag I get at points can make the game unplayable, the reporting system has finally been updated so you can finally have a reason for reporting but it still needs a little fixing around the edges.

Impossible to read, and adding also the fact that the game is RNG as fuck, while also being very poorly optimized...

BUT STILL! It is indeed to my liking, the most thought out BR out there, enabling for great replayability and a ""fun"" factor for the casuals - all the while also retaining a very high skill ceiling and competitiveness through its balancing and various mechanics, which can take some time getting used to. To me personally, I sometimes see it and tell myself that this game feels in part like sort of a homage to some of the classics we grew up with in the past, albeit with a new twist. 

I also have to rejoice that in my over a thousand now hours of playing, I've met blatant cheaters only 3 or 4 times so far (and I am playing at the highest rating/top100, if ELO matchmaking is even a thing in this game, not sure if it is or not?). Now of course, many of those I've faced could still be cheating by using map/radar hacks, indicators for loot and all that jazz, but that could be near impossible to tell anyway. The main reason I switched over from CS:GO to PUBG is because CS:GO turned into a cesspool of cheating scum from non-english speaking countries, so I found PUBG very refreshing from that point of view as well.

Now If only they can correct some minor yet important issues like hit detection and also penetration (shots hitting/blocked by bars/railings etc), raise the server tickrate, introduce some much needed QoL features in-game, etc etc... I am fairly sure that improving the game is top of their to-do list and in their best interests, so I am confident it will come sooner or later! Hopefully they don't lose their playerbase until then...

You will like this game If you can put up with it being very poorly optimized, and also if you can adjust to the desync/lag that is present as of now. 
You will also possibly love this game if you've spent hours playing the old Battlefield games, games like CS and Siege, and also various others which strike some resemblance at times, all played out as a Battle Royale mode in which the primary goal is to be the last one standing - survive (yes shroud, you don't get chicken dinners for hunting the frags which proved elusive to you in CS:GO)

2- Ricole control skill

3. How to fast boot, and places with a lotus


How to control Ricoll:

You can go one-person-on-the-go to the practice map and test yourself by picking up a player without Ricoll's equipment.

Good fun. Massively challenging. If you can't stand losing then it isn't the game for you.
But it isn't about that. It is more for the fun. Even though there are only two maps now, the odds of the plane and the circles starting and end in the same spots are low.
For me, with low skills, my only hope of winning really is good strategy, and luck with circles, timing and loot.
It is a great mix of panic, stealth, luck, strategy, teamwork, communication and shootin'!
Just because you find the best gun, doesnt mean you will find the best scope and enough ammo, leaving it somewhat pointless. Or, you find the best short range automatic gun, only to be stuck out in fields the whole time chasing the safe zones.
Whatever. Best enjoyed with mates in a squad and mixed with teamchat.

I had my doubts at first, expecting to refund the game shortly after testing it, but I was happily surprised.
I play ArmA 3, Fortnite and CS:GO and all that I've learned from these games seems to transport really well in this game too. Gameplay is fairly easy to understand and since I've been exposed to alot of videos in the last year it did help me when it came to understanding the gameplay beyond the simple ""shoot at enemies'.
Now I've only played for three hours and so far I've met quite a few nice teammates on Duo, so I guess the community seems nice so far, I've also encountered alot of Asian players, which doesnt really bother me because there again, nice people. Another reason doubted the game was for the cheating situation, I didnt encounter enough players to know so I can't really judge the game on that end yet, but if I do find alot of cheaters I'll update this review.

Anyway TL;DR - I find the game enjoyable, runs well and the community seems nice, still need to gain experience but it's easy to learn and I haven't encounterted cheaters YET.",1518632788,1518632788,True,7,0,0.578299760818481445,0,True,False,False

Cons:
-Somewhat lacking optimization, but it's getting better
-There's alot of Cheaters, especially in SEA / AS servers which is my region.
-Still unpolished although it's a Released game already
-the map Miramar needs some changes because it's sometimes boring to play in that map
-Occasional server lags
-8 tick servers half the tickrates from 16 tick servers for Fortnite
-A bit luck based

 For all of the time that I played this game in European servers, I never once feared hackers only suspected a single or two deaths as deaths by hackers (Before Kill-cam was introduced). Lags are a problem but the game has improved dramatically considering it's timespan as a running massively played game.

Yes it's not perfect, no it shouldn't have declared it's official release but it's currently @ it's peak and it was christmas so the publishers wanted the sweet sweet $, and let me tell you this, that money will go back in part back into the game it's further development.

Why so many negative reviews ?

i think the game is great fun lots of memorable moments 
and from my time playing i did not encounter any cheaters
i think most negative reviews come from pepole ho dont know how to play or there aim is wack

i mean tha game is not perfect nothing is. here are some cons:
- Game is Graphically Demanding  
- Few bugs nothing game breaking just quick restart

i would recommend 8/10 Great


New review update

new update made a game a mess here is everything wrong wiht it

- New recoil system broken on every assault rifle
- New grips why ? now you have to do more looting and the make the game unnecessarily 
  more complex guns are unusable wiht out them
- Lots of connection issuse and lag that was not there before
- Sound problems and the servers are laggy i could be bicus of traffice but it was not there 
 before 
- Bugs 
- Few other little things
- grafity in the game  that look like players why ?


ok things in the update 

- new muscle car is ok i guess and the scopes 

then devs shude have taken the time to optimaze the game get ride of bugs not this 

it harder for me to recommend this game now 4/10 meh...",1525351469,1525535261,True,4,0,0.575835466384887695,5,True,False,False

Having you pick a drop location in a specifically direct flight path, with everyone else in the map means in almost every round you are equally capable of being in a good position at the start of the game. In this sense the game is akin to playing Poker and making calls based on what you have in hand and what you think others will have.

It is in no way completely free of luck or some aspect of random nature that will help or imped your chances for winning. But at the main state of how it works, you are the one in control of your game and generally gamble the entire time to be in the best position to win.

The key to a good play is adapting yourself around what you have and what you are going to face. Both the environment you are going through or sitting inside. If you elect to stay still, you run the risk of lacking gear and other supplies for the increased chance of being in a better defensive position than others. Where as being aggressive and moving the entire round can net you more gear and equipment, but this can make you far more noticeable and generally easier to counter. This can also be the opposite for both instances as you can just as easily wait on people to loot and then ambush them for good rewards. The amount of options and strategies you can employ are very expansive, and makes each engagement really enjoyable.

The more you are able to think on your feet, or adapt to the current issue. The more likely you can overcome a disadvantage and pull out a win. In that way the game feeds into the ego and creates tension and risk/reward moments that can be utterly enjoyable or devastating. 

The games big downside is that in order to learn you must play for real. There is no practice range to learn the weapons characteristics, recoil patterns or even manage to practice item pick-up fundamentals like efficient looting or distribution of items. This often means your initial games will be met with trying to get quicker at looting and learning what you can use with each weapon and what you will prefer yourself. This is something I think it needs as a basis of being able to sharpen your base level skills and polish your reactions to better help when you are caught mid fight trying to react correctly and not accidentally miss critical shots or switch weapons by mistake.

If you enjoy the premise of this game you won't find a better game for it than this at the moment. It's core is well designed to give you the best realistic elements without overly complicating everything too much. It's simple enough that it won't take very long to learn or understand without constantly checking key-binds. But to master it all will take a good few rounds and to bring it all together in a way to net consistently high placements and wins may take a lot more losses than most are comfortable with.

But genuine wins without cheats will always be worth it. That first chicken dinner is always a brilliant moment.",1515000181,1515000671,True,4,0,0.574278056621551514,0,True,False,False

Here is why:

3. Many players to play with
4. 3 good maps to play on
5. 15-30 min game
7. ping locked games 
8. very few hackers (only reported one in two years)

Where this games fails:
1. a little lag/stutter once in awhile
2. high system requirements, because it's beautiful and fat
3. difficult to land sniping shots, learning curve here

5. buggy trying to equip clothes on customization screen

FPS on Ultra - 70-80 @ 1440p.  This is what I get on BF V.

Low for everything else.

What I really like about PUBG:

- i like the concept of the game ""The last man standing""
- I like the environment and characters it is like your are playing inside the game
- i like the duo or squad option to play with my friends


What i really dont like about this game:

- My biggest issue is the Anti cheating system of Pubg it is not accurate! i dont use any cheat or hacks or any anomalies in the game but i got permanently banned for no reasons! I contacted Steam to appeal they say contact game developer, i contacted Pubg customer support they said contact Steam. WTH! I hope they offer me refund to my 1st account.

- As it said in the PUBG it is not Fully Optimized the game and i experienced shutter lag

- After many updates of this game, the door is so slow to open unlike before when you press F it open instantly.

- Lastly, sometimes they cannot accomodate millions of users to play their game. It always prompt ""too many logins"" and sometimes inside the lobby ""server are too busy""

Over this time my opinion of PUBG has fluctuated significantly, going from adoration to contempt and everything in between. At the end of the day, it is hard to deny the game has a strong pull and is very addictive, offering up some of the highest highs gaming has to offer, while also allowing for some spectacular personal failures that might cause you to lose some sleep.

The decision to open my wallet and board that plane for the first time was one of zero regrets.
This is hands down the best multiplayer experience of last year. If I would exclude Rocket League, I haven’t been this excited when starting a match, since Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. PUBG breathes new life into a stale and predicting genre that often is most innovative in its modding scene.

The start of the match is always the same, boarding that plane. It’s loud and I grip my mouse firmly.
I am excited, the games can be unpredictable and crazy things happen on a regular basis, even more so when playing in a team of friends. Taking loot ratio and player density into account, I chose my destination on the huge map and jump. I free jump and plummet to the ground, the wind noise is numbing and in the corner of my eye I see my wife talking to me from the kitchen, thinking I can hear anything at all. The last stretch is reserved for a parachute-glide. Scanning my surroundings for enemies and possible an escape car. 

From the moment my feet touch the ground I am in a state of fear and adrenaline will drive most of my actions, for the next 20-30min. 

Minutes later, what seems like hours I lay covered in a wheatfield. There are only three of us now, three seasoned veterans, who survived 97 other people. Some were run over, one had his head burst open from a frying pan, others died of explosions, a few fell to their deaths fleeing, but most where just unlucky in the wrong place, at the wrong time. With heartbeats raised, we sneak closer to eachother, as the lethal force field that kept the match going, closes itself further, making the zone even smaller. Suddenly I hear them exchanging lead, not far from me. I take a risk, I stand up, I put my M4 rifle to my shoulder. As one of them falls to the ground, the other stands exposed, like a tree in the middle of the field. In what seems like a cloudy dream, I aim for his helmet and press the trigger. He falls unexpectedly fast to the ground and I am greeted with a chicken dinner at last. I burst out in a warcry! My wife is effortlessly trying to tell me to not scream like that, her words do not touch me. My hands are still shaking as the emotions flush over me.

Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds is a game that you cannot miss, you just can’t.

[b]Details.[/b] You and 99 other players airdrop out of a C130 in to a huge abandoned landscape filled with derelict towns, prisons, powerplants, a slew of weapons, armor, and vehicles. As you scramble to gather gear [i]a la Hunger Games[/i] a timer counts down and a large white circle appears somewhere on the map. When the countdown hits zero a blue field starts closing in, threatening to slowly sap your HP away until you either die, or get yourself into the white circle. This mechanic continues over and over, further corraling the remaining players into a smaller and smaller zone in order to increase the occurance of confrontation. The game is over when only one person, duo, trio, or squad is left.

[b]Game Modes.[/b] Single: you and 99 others are put into a last man standing struggle of life and death. Duo: partner with your buddy (or a random) to take on 49 other teams. Trio: like Duo, but with two friends (or randoms). Squad: Trio +1. One Man Squad: you are such a BAMF that you are going to take on 25 teams of four... by yourself, it must be really hard to carry those balls of yours.

One day i would like to see the devs add a few more modes, maybe a team death match, capture the flag or even a battle royale, in the same vein as H1Z1, or potentially Fortnite (if that's even possible) considering the limitations at hand.

UPDATE: Since I first posted this review, the game has improved drastically. The problem of cheaters has diminished a huge amount, and in general the game is just getting better and better. As much hate as it gets, I think this game is absolutely amazing and I still love it to bits. Every game has bugs and glitches, and honestly sometimes that can make them fun (of course, there are infuriating ones as well). Updating this review from negative to positive. Absolutely love this game.

It's a good game. A great game even, but it's getting far too much when every game you play you get into the top 5 players, only to get killed by a man who's shooting at the floor across the other side of the zone. Or to drop in perfectly at your destination, before everyone else, only for your parachute to get stuck in the air or taking half of your health from fall damage after dropping 2 feet. Or trying to vault over a wall and dying for no reason at all. Or the bloody awful desync, being behind cover then getting shot by a man who's seeing 10 seconds ago. I keep playing this game, it's actually incredibly fun and action packed, but there's a lot of stuff that needs to be fixed with it. The hackers are by far the worst thing at the moment, and more and more keep appearing by the day (most commonly, based on my experience, players from Asian servers who come to EU servers and cheat. I'm sure there are a heck of a lot of players who play on EU from Asia that don't cheat, it just seems suddenly that a lot more keep playing).

Yes, it's got its ups and downs, but that's expected from any game. Even the most advance games today have flaws. With that being said, I want to look at the good and the bad side of Player Unknown's Battle Grounds.

This game was the first smash-hit battle royal game I don't need to get into the backgrounds of this game, thought I do recommend you do it. It's a good read! This game basically introduced a whole new side to gaming. 100 players drop into an arena and it's survival of the fittest. The game itself is very fun. During the beginning stages of a match, you land in a zone and scrounge for items. Depending on what you get, (pistol, shotgun, rifle, sniper or a frying pan) could determine rather you end up on top of the world, or down in a hole were a 12-year-old kid triumphantly loots your decomposing corps. Things can go 2 ways, for a PUBG player. Either they want to be the Alpha wolf and go hunt its prey like sheep, or people act like the sheep and hide from those who hunt them down. Somewhere in between are the players who don't know the difference between a Flash Hider and a Compensator. 

Good aspects:
This game can and will give you an adrenaline rush. Probably not until you make it to the top 15, but you will get it sooner or later. The satisfactory of winning a shoot-out, landing a perfect headshot, looting an air drop and get the good weapons, or after hours and hours of playing and grinding, you finally earn that tasty chicken dinner. The feeling I had when I won my first solo game was fantastic, and I will never forget it.

This game is also very fun when it comes to playing with friends. Teaming up and going as a duo, or a 4-man squad can be an amazing experience and delivers a whole new set of challenges. Loot becomes more scarce between players and now killing someone isn't as easy as landing a perfect headshot. Make sure you finish off those who are knocked down or they'll bite you back later.

Another thing that I personally like is that there isn't a level-up system. Every single player has the same advantage as the other 99, unless you have the skills of a god (Talking about Shroud here). If you drop in a building with another guy, you'd better find something to finish him off before he does it to you. 

Bad aspects:
With every good, there is a bad. This game may be good, but there are the bads.

First off, there is only 1 game mode. I personally am not that good at the game. I've won some, but lost WAY more. It's difficult to practice learning the weapons because you need to be in a game, then you need to find them. Snipers, as you can imagine, are relatively rare. So practicing with one won't always happen.

Another thing is the sheer difficulty of the game. Now some people will disagree with me on this one (which is fine) but this game takes a lot of time, practice, patience, and anger management. This game WILL make you want to break something.

The loot system could be better. Personally, I don't think there should be a market for the items. I like games where you don't have to spend a fortune to get some of the coolest items in the game. Look at games like Overwatch, COD, and a few others. You earn credits in-game to buy specific items that look awesome. Despite the fact that there are ways to do this, it's nearly impossible to do it. I personally would love one of the new leather hoodies, but I will not be spending $800 to get one. I wish items were unlocked and not bought. If this were the case, I'd love this game even more. 

Next are the bugs/glitches. As I said earlier, every game has a few. However this game has way more than a few. I've lost games for dumb reasons (stuck in walls, fell down a hole and can't get out, or just dying for absolutely no reason) and it can be frustrating. This is where Early Access comes into place. This game was in it for a little less than a year and just recently came out of it. Was it ready for it? I cannot say that it was, and still is.

Last of all are the cheaters. Every game has them, no matter what. It's sad that people will always take a fantastic game and ruin it by making their odds of winning significantly higher than the other player. I cannot say that they're a horrific problem because I don't encounter them very often (Maybe 3-4 that are very obvious), but they're there nonetheless. So keep that in mind if you're thinking about buying this game.

PUBG is not a game for everyone. It's for those who like things intense, challenging, and strategic. You need to make smart moves in order to win, instead of going into a gun fight all willy-nilly hoping your random bullets make contact with someone. 

So do I recommend this game? Yes I do. It's got potential, even if its got its bugs. 

I give this game a 7/10. A few things need to be worked on, and I hope it becomes the game everyone wants to see!",1516217627,1516217627,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

It's a extremely appealing game with all ages playing and a fast growing community to back it up.

CORE GAMEPLAY

The game is a 100 player ffa but with a max of 4 people in a squad the game consists mainly of looting and is 50% looting and 50% fighting. The game begins with a plane flying over a island there are many spots to jump out into and once landed its a ffa. Whilst playing a blue barrier will in-circle the island and kill anything outside of it and it will result in players coming together.

COMMUNITY AND APPEAL

This games community is not an easy one to settle into it is 'toxic' and 'salty' and you will mainly be flamed. This game is extremely competitve (resulting in salt) and is great for anyone that is in to a competitive shooter like CSGO which is where I came from.

PERSONAL STORY AND REVIEW

I believe this is a very great game especially to play with friends and is a great game for only 30 AUD. With a strong, backing and growing player base PlayerUnknows Battlegrounds is a fantastic game and its position at #1 of the most players playing on steam is well deserved though the only problem I found is the computer system requirements which have since upgraded with frame drops though minor it is something to note

I am a veteran FPS player coming from games like CS, Quake then a little bit through Battlefield, Modern Warfare etc.

The game is basically about you choosing where to land from the plane parachute drop and try to stay alive from 99 other oponents. As simple as that! You land with no gear and you can get gear from looting in buildings and from looting an oponent you kill. Gear gives you an advandage over other players but the biggest advantage you can get is from Personal Strategy and skill.

The concept is fantastic, great gameplay!
If you are into killing 20-30 people then this is not your average shoot-them-up game because you may be 10 minutes into the game without seeing a soul. Later stages of the game guarantee a kill or two, depending on your style.
A game lasts maximum of 30 minutes if you make it to the end. You can expect an average of 2-5 kills if you are playing safe or if you are really good you can even have an average of 7-10kills. If you are a beast then you may even do better than that.
Even if you are a newbie, you can still win the game if you play smart and stay alive. You just gotta take that last kill on the 1 vs 1. 
You can also play DUO with a random Teammate or a friend. You can also play Squad with a total of 4 to a team. (3 additional team members). They can be all friends of yours or you can go for random.

Althought it started out being laggy, demanding a high power gaming pc (just like all great games out there),  with sound needing a lot of improvement (footsteps, you din't know if they are above you or below you) and definitely needing a couple of more maps. All these issues were gradually addressed to and the Devs team really took the game to another level. It's constantly improving and to me, totally deserved the Best Game of the Year Award!!!

 Overall i believe it's a great game and week in week out it is still being improved.

Very good value for money too.

No. But somehow, this glitchy, broken, poorly balanced mess of a game manages to elicit burning passion, positive or negative. PUBG is a story of an arguably great, maybe brilliant gameplay loop that manages to shine through the hectic and often frustrating issues the game has. PUBG has done the hardcore Battle Royale better and more efficiently than anyone else has been able to. The argument can be made for Arma BR, but PUBG, at least for the moment, has the playerbase to make it worthwhile to play. If you enjoy battle royale, definitely give PUBG a try. If you don't, it will likely be a miserable experience full of indiosyncracies that are funny to laugh at for the first 50 times, but quickly get old. Like most games, playing with friends can be a riot, and squad play is the only way to play if you don't want to spend most of your time frustrated at your bad luck.

I don't think PUBG is GoTY material, nor am I convinced that is can even be considered a good game, but the fact of the matter is that PUBG is the only game that can routinely provide the adrenaline and the blood rush that I've only ever felt in a 1 v 5 clutch situation in CSGO, or maybe RS6.

Above were my previous thoughts on the game. I will say that I believe that it has improved massively. A lot of my major concerns from 2017 and 2018 have been solved. I believe the game is in a much better state than ever, and I believe that it is currently the best battle royale on the market. If you are considering getting it, go for it. It is incredibly addictive and is one of the best sub $30 games I have ever purchased.

(+) Graphics quality on Unreal Engine 4
(+) Large map and diverse terrains and towns
(+) Practical gunplay 
(+) No microtransactions or premium currency (purely cosmetical and largely irrelevant)
(+) Flow of gameplay is decently paced
(+) Speed of matchmaking is almost instantaneous 

NEUTRAL: (~) Customization could have more depth
(~) General structure of looting, fighting, and moving (adds capacity for competitive mechanics, but also for repetitive boredom)
(~) Loot drops can be inconsistent  

CONS: (-) Poor use of Battle Points currency (has no intrinsic value or purpose)
(-) Requires decent hardware to play effectively
(-) Lack of variety in weapon choice
(-) Constant server lag and frame rate issues
(-) Probably would not recommend duo or squad with randoms

Возможно, это тоже стоило отнести в минусы). 
Лично мне читеры встречались крайне редко, а то и вообще не встречались. Если вы играете соло и ставите сквад, то в пати вам могут попасться неадекватные школьники, но бывают и исключения, поэтому интереснее играть с друзьями или просто соло. 
Также, если вы купите или получите PUBG, у вас будет абсолютная возможность окупить свое приобретение, продавая кейсы на площадке стим или на сторонних сайтах. Ну и, т.к игре всего год - в ней присутствует всего 3 карты на данный момент, они конечно малость надоедают, но это мелочи.
И хочу предупредить: если у вас интегрированная видеокарта с пеньком - ни в коем случае не покупайте данную игру, потому что очень сильно пожалеете.


Generally. The game is raw, with a bunch of bugs and sagging FPS - and it's all its cons. But, strangely enough interesting and addictive. In it you can play with your friends (the party can consist only of 4 people, maybe it's also worth attributing to the minuses).
Personally, I found cheaters very rare, and even never met. If you play solo and put squads, then in the party you may get inadequate schoolchildren, but there are exceptions, so it's more fun to play with friends or just solo.
Also, if you buy or receive PUBG, you will have an absolute opportunity to recoup your purchase by selling cases to the Steam platform or to third-party sites.

I've had an absolute blast playing this game after getting it as a gift from my friend. Despite being from Asia I can play on NA servers with ease, however there is rubberbanding in the early game.
You'll see a shit ton of negative rewiews about how the game is broken, shitty, etc. But if you check out the people that typed the rewiews you'll see that they're still playing the game. That's just how fun it is. Even if you hate it, you won't stop playing it.

The developers are actually working hard on this game despite what people say. I've seen it with the 1.0 patch and the instant perfomance boost I got from it. I'm not kidding, it blew me away how much smoother the game ran for me with that update. The new map and other content with it was also amazing.

Expect games to rubberband and lag for at least the first five minutes of every match. Don't expect it to get better after the first five minutes, but get excited because it -MIGHT- get more stable. 

This game started out as a full-bodied great game, with fixes incoming for the handle of frustrations. To me, it has now become the epitome of an Early Access Nightmare. Errors, crashes, and instabilities everywhere, with no reliable fixes in sight.

The name itself is epic, therefore explains one of the reasons why i love it.
This game was recommended to my by some of my friends, and i was instantly caught by it and now i can't stop playing it. PUBG, as it is called in short really started the Battle Royale genre and is a really good, and a high populated game and hella fun.

Optimization, and graphical demand.
The game is poorly omtimized, and even on pretty high end systems like mine (check my desc for specs) runs poorly on high graphic settings. I play on low to get the most fun out of the game and even then i find occational stutters. On the lowest settings the grapics are nothing to brag about and more looks like something that has been drawn by a child. Overall gameplay is really fun, but the glitches and stuff randomly not loading defintly has a downside to the games overall fun rating.

PUBG, an immersive and innovative 100 player battle royale game. Alone or with up to 3 friends, you fight for winning and/or getting the best loot posible in the game. Battle underground, on water, or on land with the many vihiceles that are currently in the game. 

The game has recently been launched on Xbox, and therefor the game was put out of early access. I think they could do so much for the optmization and for the current price it really isnt worth buying if you don't like potato graphics.

Now you could say ""well I gave thema negative review because they are ignoring us on giving china the region lock"" but thenwhat about the other player base? Should we get a region lock?

The feeling of sneaking around the bushes, circle closing in, knowing that there is only one other person left...
For those who argue PUBG is a ""bush simulator"", or is too slow paced, there is always Sanhok, which is a quarter of the size of the other maps and the same amount of people.

Pros:
- Decent graphics
- Pretty easy to pick up
- LOTS of replayability, I have 500 hours and counting on it
- After region lock and the slowly evolving anti-cheat, not many hackers at all
- Tense gameplay
- Awesome firefights
- Team/trust-building
- Devs that are trying to fix it (Hence the ""Fix PUBG"" roadmap)
- A pan that blocks bullets
- Many, many guns
- An absence of Fortnite and its toxic, toxic little children
- Realistic, hardcore gameplay

Cons
- Sniped out of nowhere DayZ style (But not so much on the two latest maps, worst on Miramar)
- VERY difficult to win, unless you are a GOD.

Don't listen to them, PUBG is a wonderfull game wich I will be going to spend a LOT more hours into than I've already done.

Review:
PUBG is a thrilling and exciting battle royale shooter with some serious good mechanics. I've played this game since the first time you could buy it and I still really enjoy playing it casually or just hardcore sometimes. It's awesome playing with friends and even though solo play feels a bit lonely, it's still incredibly competetive and fun.

PRO'S:
- 60+FPS is the most wonderfull feeling when playing this game, wich can now be done even with a GTX 970.
- Bullet drops is f*ck*ng awesome and feels really realistic.
- You can honk in your car, buggy, truck or motorcycle, this is a serious +.
- Vaulting over objects make for fast and smooth gameplay.
- It's cheap compared to the amount of fun I am getting out of it (30 euros!).
- The reward system is really awesome and there is NO pay to win aspect.
- You can actually earn some serious cash playing this game and selling the items you win in-game (I've made 114 euros so far).
- Buy this game! It's good.

CONS:
- There's still some bugs here and there, nothing major and long lasting. Usually this only happens at the start.
- Motorcycles are 100x more dangerous than in real life, avoid these at all costs or be prepared to die.

Again, buy this game if you want to have some serious fun. I r8 this game 8/8 m8. If you do happen to buy this game and encounter me in-game, be prepared to battle, because I am starving and I'd like myself some chicken dinner.",1514325796,1514326027,True,4,0,0.554615020751953125,0,True,False,False

You definitely should!
why you ask?here we go.

Pros:
1)Very realistic and accurate phyics,where you bump into invisible textures and vehicles starts to spin above ground due to paranormal activities of the unseen.
2)Game sometimes randomly crashes to give you a small break between games.
3)Get killed by third-person campers who got whole day to camp behind walls(if you dont play Fpp).
4)Recoil control is very easy with the RNG randomness everytime.
5)You can pray to the RNG Gods for better circles(atleast you have hope,the Gods might listen to your prayers).
6)Best of all the servers might be busy to give you break from your lonely life.

Cons:
ABSOLUTELY NONE.

Even though things are much better than before now and changes are occuring but at a slower pace than expected.Anyways
THIS IS BATTLE ROYALE!

[b]RIO DE JANEIRO SIMULATOR 2018![/b]
With Chinese guys all over the servers and a lot of netcode issues!
GAME OF THE YEAR MY DUDES!

WHY TO RELEASE FIXING UPDATES WHEN U CAN RELEASE A BUNCH OF COSMETICS AND NON
SENSE THINGS!!!!!!!!!!
BLUEHOLE BEST GAME COMPANY IN THE WORLD!

Ok, i was joking about the Bluehole beign the best company in the world.... duuuuuuh
The game is very fun when everything is working, but that doesn't happens a lot
there is a lot of conection errors, graphic errors, netcode errors, and all the possible shit that a game can have
BUT. They reward feeling when u get a winner winner is like one of the best things u can have in a game, its like removing 80kg of your back!!!
Personaly i don't like playing this alone, its always funnier with your friends, or even with some random dudes(good chances they will gonna be chinese) 
I really recomend to play this game with your friends, but they NEED to be great friends, otherwise you will loose they'r friendship yelling and cursing they'r moms and they past entities.

BUY THIS GAME! What can be better than that? 
When u die miserably by any mistake of yours or the game beign a piece of crap you can join another game fast if the game doesn't frozes on the loading screen(what happens a lot more that i expected)
But after all its a good game, as i said, VERY REWARDLY! 
GG GUYS SEE YOU NEXT WEEK. 

Lets put some more milions of dollars into bluehole balance and HOPE that someday they will fix everything that is kinda messed up in the game! 
For the price its still worthing a lot.

When I first got the game, it was pretty fun. After a few 30 hours of gameplay, it got boring. I hated it. I felt like the game favored campers and it was laggy. I couldn't get better, and I felt like playing was just a waste of time. Get a gun, make it to the top 10, die, repeat. After a while, I was just sick of this. It encouraged me to build my own PC, so I did. And let me tell you, it was worth it.

With 70-100 FPS at ultra settings, the game looked absolutely stunning. I realized the game wasn't terribly optimized, but that I had a potato PC. Many will say the game is terribly optimized, which is only half true. It could be optimized a little better, but they have to realise it is a realistic looking game, not a cartoon like game. The graphics have to be solic to look realistic.

Now to the gameplay. I have realized that the game does not favor camping, but instead favors players who go out and play the game like it should be played: players who go out exploring, grabbing loot, and moving on. Camping may get you a very low amount of easy kills if at all any, but will almost guarantee a loss. After gaining faster reflexes and better game sense, defeating campers is a breeze. Trust me, the game will get much better if you just keep taking time into it. The game also has very large maps and they are THE BEST. You can tell the developers took time into making the maps instead of quickly adding a new, boring map. There is so much to explore in the maps. Quality over quantity, amitire?

TL;DR, this game takes serious time to get used to. The game may seem boring at first, but after taking time into it, the game gets extremely addictive and fun. Also maps are very fun to play on.",1529553654,1529553654,True,9,0,0.550146698951721191,0,True,False,False

(PUBG, is somewhat resurrected. Not dead, yet. Neither is it dying as I once thought.)

I admit, I come from a bias point of view with regards to PUBG.
Yet, I cannot withhold my critique of the game and her flaws. 
Since the latest update (Ledge-grab & D-eagle), my squad and I have noticed something quite peculiar. There is more rubber-banding while in game. 
The hit-ratio is better for specific guns, while other guns, the hit-ratio does not seem to register. 

This may probably be my squad's end, and not the server; clarification would be helpful to the hit-ratio of the DP28. (Half drum into 1 guy, never down; Blood is seen, Flinch is seen) 

As a follow up, this latest update is a medley of new additions, (D-eagle -Status Gun-, Ledge Grab -Useful-, and Amphibious Assault Vehicle -PUBG Juggernaut-). On this front, PUBG never failed to deliver. 

The only problem is the constant rubber-banding and lag spikes I never received before this update. 



My shots, still register, but not as much as the previous update. (Still had room for improvement)

The occasional latency, pkt loss, rubber-banding and lag  are the determining factors in the game for my squad and I. If low ping, high fps, it's glorious. 

Another noticeable problem with the latest update, the frames actually drop whilst playing on Erangle, and Vikendi. Much more than what I had previously.

(Before I continue, I'd like to express my (hilarious disappointment) in PUBG for the low blow in terms of this season's pass. More scantly clad in nature, but, it will add to the humor further down the line.) - I'm still expecting for it to continue. 

This game still remains to test one's patience, and duly so. Also depending on one's graphics card, you can strategise on how you can get that chicken dinner. 

Rule of Thumb: [Know the rig's limit , adjust the graphics accordingly, play low-key stealth until you get a better graphics card]

If you want to know how to snag a steady FPS of 100 & above, I'm listing the settings down here for those who still wish to play. 

(Update: GTX1070) 

130-190 fps
[Personal]
Lobby FPS cap -30FPS
In-game FPS -Unlimited-
Anti-aliasing (Very Low)
Post Processing (Very Low)
Shadows (Very Low)
Nvidia Replay (Disabled)
Textures (Very Low)
Effects (Very Low - Low)
Foliage (Very Low)
V-sync (Disabled)
Sharpen  (Disabled)
Motion blur  (Disabled)
FPP-FOV (80-85)
Resolution Rendering (80)


(-This game is not meant to be played pretty-)
It is a game for the laughs, for cremating friends, and talking a load of shit towards one another. 


This game, though not meant to be played pretty is also not meant to be played in TPP. I notice whenever I play on TPP, and when my mates play on TPP, we lag more than we do on FPP.  

Those who wield a GTX 1060, 1070 or 1080, keep the graphics to a minimum, not to high if you want to maximize your performance in game. 

The novelty and originality of the game still has me hooked and coming back for more punishment. Many said I'm attracted to a corpse (PUBG), but, not really. Its still alive and kicking, but, it is somewhat abandoned. OC server is pretty much extinct. But EU & AS are alive and well.  


PROS of PUBG (30-march-2019)
1. Open World Concept 
2. Team Based
3. Can be used for sick comedy 
4. Rely on own style and tactics 
5. Great way to let off steam
6. Stealth
7. Action
8. Timing
9. As realistic as it gets
10. The rush of adrennaline you find in this game cannot be found elsewhere in others like (Fortnite & APEX) 
11. The kick in PUBG is now increased.

CONS of PUBG  (30-march-2019)
1. Bugs (Less so)
2. Hackers (Still an issue)
3. Anti-Cheat system not really working (Has been improved/ still needs work)
4. VPN Abusers rampant (Unsure)
5. Some random bastard you team with kills you without any repercussions
6. Salty ass community in terms of streamers, randoms, etc (Streamer community for this game is pretty much dead except for the few youtubers who still play PUBG)
7. Desync & Ping 

Improvements made
1. Shots register more 
2. Game feels smoother
3. Desync improved 




(Final Comments)
Personal recommendation:. 

GTX 
1060 (Minimum/Starting point) 115 - 140 FPS
1070
1080 (Medium-range budget -PC) [Higher FPS]

[Advice from my PC mate] 
[Dealing in hardware/graphics cards/CPU/Mother Boards and Ram]
RTX, though it is good, is not recommended for PUBG, due to the constant driver updates that is required before getting it steady.
The power consumption is high, (rack-up the electricity bill) [to each his own]
Over-heats easily. 

RTX (Pretty & Heavy duty performance)
2060 (Medium - high end budget) [Small Gas Guzzler] (Not as much)
2070 (High-end budget) [Queen Gas Guzzler]
2080 (Unnecessarily overpowered |wealth binge budget) [King Gas Guzzler]

If you want to upgrade a GTX to an RTX, make sure it is compatible with your rig's power supply before installing. 

Unfortunately, 1070 is running out of stock. 1080, where I'm at, barely exists.

_____________________________________________

(UPDATE)
-Fortnite, is still bullshit. Apex, mega bullshit. I tried a bit more Apex, clocked in 10 hours as of now, over the span of 6 days with utter disappointment. 
(Drop, die) [Overwatch-like heroes] 

PUBG still has that kick for me. Still pisses me off from time to time; still can't seem to stay away from it. 

Still a decent game where you can cremate your friends after a long day at work and at University. A good de-stress game, for the laughs, crazy shit and unpredictable nature.

[I do notice that the player-base in Apex & Fortnite are both extremely toxic] 
PUBG also has its fair share of toxicity, but not as much as Apex and Fortnite. 

[Reason for Bias in favor of PUBG]
Game-play- no two games are alike
Game forces you to rely on squad and gut instincts
Never ceases to amaze the player-base with new and OP weapons/features

It separates the players according to style [not heroes or pre-made juggernauts [apex reference) 

i.e. Some players make good medics and Support, others make better snipers while some are just good at breaching.
[the play-style is a determining factor, not predetermined by a hero] 

Critique: 
Need for improvements 
-Hit-ratio
-Latency issues
-Pkt Loss 
-Server issues
-Can be better optimized 


[Apex Legends / Overwatch-PUBG mutation] 
Heroes- gives the player a choice of character
-Gives players a certain ego in-game 
-Boosts ego, disregarding team-work based on abilities (predetermined)
-Lack of teamwork (hard to find unless you're with some close buddies of yours) 

[Fortnite]
-Hit ratios are decent
-Graphics and Bullets; unrealistic as..
-No Bullet Drop
-Can build own castle",1520377953,1562445454,True,3,0,0.550000011920928955,0,True,False,False

For that reason alone it might be worth a try. However, the game still suffers from some issues that are core to its gameplay and, at least to me, really impacts its enjoyability. At the top of the list is bad performance/fps even with minimal graphic settings on higher tier comps. Furthermore the balancing of gameplay with the punishing play zone dynamics, highly variable loot and extremely clunky/slow player movement gives it an aura of being dominated by randomness where it is often very hard to know what you could have done differently. Currently there are also no practice servers or ways to create empty servers or to play around with the guns in the spawn boxes outside normal games.

Can be lots of fun with friends in a relaxed atmosphere, but don't expect a competitive shooter. At least not yet.  It will be exciting to see what can come out of the competition between PUBG and a increasingly popular Fortnite.

And this is just the first patch, there is more to come. You can read everything in the Dev's blog a week ago. Yes, Locked lootboxes is a thing, even if you pay with Battle points.

This games tells one of the most gripping and depressing stories I've ever expirienced in my life. It made me feel really depressed, then really happy, and letting it ferment in my mind just makes me really happy and sad at the same time. I'm on the brink of literal tears writing this review right now lol, it's kind of embarassing.

Jelikož PUBG je již vypuštěná raketa tak k tomuto počinu nebudu příliš moc dodávat. Všichni už máme asi nějaký idea jaká ta hra asi je, ale z mého pohledu...

Grafika není nic extra, ale to ani není problém protože stejně 99.991% lidí hraje na Low-ish nastavení, ať už kvuli (btw) poor optimalizaci, nebo kvuli pushnutí maximálních fps.

Zvuky v PUBG jsou actually great, průstřely nad hlavou, z dálky, zvuky zbraní, vozidel, chůze, nemám s ničím problém. System slyšení střel může být trochu confusing nejdřív, ale je realisticky pojatý.

Gameplay je taky pojatý poměrně realisticky, od animací až po typ pohybu. Sice bych uvítal spíše víc ""arcadish"" movement, protože v něm se mi střílí a míří mnohem líp, ale je to takové jaké to je.

A co se týče celé té maškarády s fpskama, server lagama atp. Ta byla z větší stránky opravena. Už jen občas padnou servery (ne na moc dlouho). Ale fps či server lagging a rubber banding už nebývá potíž. Při nejhorším dveře se občas špatně registrují. 
K hitboxům řeknu akorát tak to, že když je můj aim v týhle hře tak mega thrash, tak nevím zda je trefuju nebo ne, takže nemůžu posoudit (lmao).

Ye dats it. Přes všechny svoje (teď už celkem drobné) flaws, je ta hra zábava, ikdyž je to takový ten recept ""milion bolestivých momentů pro jeden absolutně úžasný"", ale to se mění od hráče na hráče a opírá se to o jeho ""skill"".

However, i cannot confirm most of these reviews.. Most of the time, people talk about bugs and bad server tick rates.. i have not really experienced any of those. Of course, sometimes you're sitting in the plane and can't jump out, sometimes your car is doing weird things, but overall it's not as full of bugs as people say. I'm using a GTX 1060 (6GB Vram) and an Intel i5-8400, and most of the time i have more than 100 fps, except for big cities like Yasnaya or Poch1nki (edit: apparently this name is being censored by steam) ... And for those saying it was full of cheaters, well.. you're probably just bad or don't have enough experience with weapons. PUBG is permantly trying to get rid of cheaters, for instance you can't play PUBG with family-shared accounts anymore. On the other hand, its kinda true that it's still 30€ and they probably added weapons to make more profit, but this money can also be spend to reinvest on the game.. unlike fortnite, they only get money when people buy the game or when you sell/buy a weapon skin on the steam market (taxes). They are currently working on a new map which again requires money. Speaking about Fortnite.. it has become a competitor to PUBG, and therefore PUBG is constantly losing players, earning less money. If you're thinking about buying this game, you should only do it if you're certain about your CPU/GPU and believe in PUBG's developing progress.

All games have bugs, issues, glitches. People will find them and complain about them. This game in particular has a lot. And it has a lot of cheaters, but I don't run into them much. I still win games. Not super often, but hunting people is all the fun anyway. 

So yeah, it's far from perfect.
But here's why I like it.
Adrenaline.

If you're someone who considers themselves a thrill seeker or an adrenaline junky, then buy this game. Despite it's issues, it releases adrenaline into your body comparable to roller coasters. And that's the bottom line, cause stone cold said so.

As far as the chinese flooding the NA servers, just add some friends to your steam when you meet them in game.

Please.. ban cheaters.
Give an update/make announcement how many cheaters that had been banned every week.
And it's quite hard to report teamers/cheaters/hackers, because need terms and conditions such as:

- player must know date & time when the offense occured
(if it happened two weeks ago, this way still works? or must report it immediately after?)

- in game names of suspected chaters / teamers
(Like seriously? names who killed me dissapear not long after it show up. My brain and hands not fast enough to capture that moment because i was shoked, so make it last longer on screen)

- video evidence of teamers / cheater
(Oh now u want us to video all our game? not all of us not streamer, or super pc master race, or have 1000 Mbps DL/UL internet speed. And videos preferable posted via external link through twitch/youtube and similar platform.. really?. And in test server when i got killed in such ridiculous way, killcam always off / no killcam option, and it`s one of evidence but we cant see /record it)

pls developers must give new features like:
- replays which have player prespective view (so player can recheck from killer/cheater point of vew)

- can watch other people game (so we can learn how to play from pro player, lucky enough people caught cheaters in action from cheater's prespective)

- killcam that can be send as a report as recorded video dirrectly to developer

- some times it's quite hard how to distinguish pro player with god aim or the one with aimbot. Like knocked while i'm have lvl 2 helmet on, and he shoot me 2/3 times, and headshoot only with UMP in such a distance (on 23"" screen, shooter heigh was like less than 5 millimeter) how to tell he was cheater or pro player with god aim or just a lucky player.
Developer should consider putting ranked match into this game..
let god aim vs god aim rank, which is nice

One last advice, you need patience(for real xD), mostly on the first hours because while you are understanding the game no one will be merciful, it is not like you will be fighting every second but sometimes it's frustrating to die without shooting a single bullet,

The game started off extremely buggy, just like any early access game in it's early stages, yet BlueHole was very responsive and was constantly releasing patches. However, I definitely can't say that the game is recieving the same attention now, as it did a few months ago.

I believe that the creators do care about PUBG, and want it to progress, instead of being like many other early access scams like dayZ, but the main problem is that they arent following up on their promises. Honestly, I cant trust anything that comes out of Brendan Greene's mouth after BlueHole promisied to create extra measures to prevent Chinese players from playing on EU and NA servers with 200+ ping (Ping lock), and infesting TPP and alot of FPP games with cheats, yet havent followed up on that, and the community got called ""Xenophobic"" by Brendan Greene for suggesting region locking China, where an overwhealming amount of cheats come from. Right now, we need some updates to further prevent cheats, which will ultimately have to be region locking China.

Dont get me wrong, I absloutely love this game. I think its an awesome idea, executed perfectly. I really like the new gameplay updates coming out (The 2x is finally usable?!?!.) But I still feel like BlueHole may be catering to the Chinese audience instead of the rest of us because it brings in the most money. Hopefully we can get a ping lock sooner or later. 

Overall, I definitely do recommend this game, loads of fun with friends or alone, heck, even with randoms! The nostalgia of being in a top 10 position is insane, and getting kills and winning feels much more rewarding than games like Fortnite.",1521142542,1561497214,True,3,0,0.546925604343414307,0,True,False,False

From 600 hours of gameplay plus another 600 of watching people stream the game on Twitch, I believe I can pinpoint the type of person who would enjoy it.

PUBG is for gamers who enjoy: 
 - the thrill of an extremely hard-earned victory
 - the challenge of playing against other humans in PVP
 - the freedom to play as aggressively or passively as they prefer, and still be rewarded
 - the freedom to go anywhere you wish and try different strategies
And perhaps most importantly:
 - the chance to constantly improve and adapt after failure and defeat

There is a lot of failure and defeat in this game.  

There are some bugs too, but I personally am not bothered too much by the bugs.  I quit playing when the hacking was out of control, but it improved quickly.  The bugs are very annoying, but you can learn to play around them.  

If you are someone who rages when things do not go your way, do not play this game.  You will get beat a lot, mostly because of your own mistakes.  There are enough bugs that it is very easy to blame the bugs instead of your mistakes, and if you fall into that trap you will never get any  better.  So if you rage easily, don't waste your time.

A note on PUBG Corp and their failure to fix issues:  the game is most popular in China, and in China Third Person Perspective (TPP) is the most popular mode.  Players put a lot of stock in their appearance.  PUBG is filling this need through pay-to-look-good options.  Players who enjoy the more competitive FPP rarely see themselves and care much less about clothes and more about game performance.  PUBG has, predictably, focused more on the money than on optimization.  Like the many negative reviews on Steam, I agree that PUBG is making a mistake in this regard; however, unlike most of the reviews, I still enjoy playing the game.

At release, I had overlooked this game heavily. All the reviews pointed me out of the direction of this game, as do most with early access titles. But PUBG was different...

After a few cocktails, I said screw it and picked up the title. BOYY! The heart renching adrenaline that I got while playing is what kept me addicted. Even with the heavy stress for mediocre graphics and the Pixelated late loading houses, I couldn't get enough! People is really what makes this game fun. Sure the map may be the same, but every game is different and depending on where you jump, options are endless.

Graphically, the game is decent. Well rounded and doesnt shy away from details. Although The memory tole that the game takes will have you wanting to get another 8 gigs of ram if your sitting on 8 already or god forbid 4. As with most games, loading time can be a pain if your running off of a HDD, but this can be heavily reduced by purchasing a SSD.

Bugs are not as big an issue as they were previously and the developers fix issues regularly. (With a flagship like PUBG why wouldn't you) Gameplay can feel choppy to anyone with a mediocre to sub-par PC, if trying to play on Med-High to Max settings.

It's optimized now, there is so much more content than before.  When this game came out, it was just the medium fries.  Now, it's the whole gawd dang meal.

Update 7/16/19
So I have completed all the achievements for PUBG, getting that 10th crossbow kill was a b****.  Here's the thing though.  The game is positively OVERRUN by hackers right now.  If you're looking for high quality PUBG gameplay, you should wait until you've seen another ""30 million banned accounts"" article online.  It's so bad right now, I caught two hackers today alone.

Update 9/12/19
I've reached 4,000 SP for the rank of Specialist.  I've written a guide on SP that has gotten over 40 reviews, and a 4 star rating.

Best battle royale game in my opinion, I love everything  with it.
They have some amazing maps, good graphics, good servers and good shooting mechanics etc.
It's a ""must have"" game, I don't play it often but sometimes I just crave it and need to play it.

I'm not saying that it's perfect, it do have some minor bugs but nothing that make you lose a whole match or something like that,

conclusion: Amazing battle royale game, highly recommended. Is it worth the full price you might ask, I would probably say yes, if you have some money to spend. It really is a good game.

I rate: 8/10

ok so lets start with the big one {fps} this game would be fanfucking tastic if the fps was improved for example streamers like shroud dr.disrespect, tsm viss (just to name a few) have amazing rigs worth in the $1000
and yet they are getting 140 to 130 fps consistently this pc market is a wide market with high end rigs to low end most people dont have expensive rigs so they have to deal with 40 to at most 80fps which in this game is unplayable  i am a unreal engine user i am quite femilular with it if you want to improve the fps get rid of useless objects such as broken down cars, random boxes ect they dont give ciniemantic value to me to me they are useless and anoying stupid objects witch have no value in the first place 

Drop rates now this is one of the smaller issues but at this point it should be fixed if you want everyone to have a fair fight make stuff like adrenaline shots, kar98k,m24,awm i am not the only one thinking that awm is so rare at this point you barely even aquire it at all out of my 260.7hrs of playing this game i only had it once 

weapon damage now this sement is to do with shot guns mostly so digress with me shot guns are a huge topic with pubg they are common weapons but they are useless i would rather use a pistol than a shotgun they are way to under powerd and long range forget it by long range i mean 50 meters dose fuck all at most if you are lucky 2 dmg please fix this 

have you ever aimed derectly at a guys head and missed complitely yeah that happens way to often at this point its just porly game design it happens way to much  fix this by making the hit boxes bigger or clunckyer 

anyway it is fun but newer players are detererated from playing the game because you are matched up with people who are 6000x better than you and how are you suppose to learn if i where in your position i would implament a tutorial, training area where you can learn the basics of the weapons and train you aim movement ect 

but it is a good game dont get me wrong but they are just to many factors to save this game from dieing slowly i doubt that pubg with fix most of these issues 

overall i would rate it a solid 6.7/10
pubg please please please fix your game that all we want and then pubg will prosper once again

Pros: PUBG has improved greatly since early access. They optimised it very well, to the point where i get simular frame rates as if I was in fortnite, and updated their servers from 32 tick to 64 tick. This greatly improved combat and feel of the game. They even added new grips, sights, customization for the sights, and new maps.  Compared to its F2P competitor, that only has a $0 price tag as a pro. 

Cons : But of course, there is cons to this game as there is to every game. One would be the crates. I auctually enjoyed unboxing the crates using the BP you get from matches, until the added crates that required keys. If you're gonna do that, then atleast give us an option to buy the keyless crates. Second, the parachuting. As you land above the crates in Novo or Georgopol, the parachute can get stuck or teleport you to the ground. 

Overall, pubg is an experience you will enjoy for many hours, unless you just don't like battle royal games. So stop with all these negative reviews complaing about server and performance jeez, it's your garbage pc and internet that's causing you these problems.",1527967683,1527967683,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Yes Battle Royale concept is there however PUBG is much less forgiving than Fortnite. Positioning in this game is key, in Fortnite you can just build your way out of trouble. The feeling of being top 20 is very intense in this game, very good late game. However the mid game in PUBG is basically running/driving simulator. Half of your games you will chase the circle/ look for people but find none. The problem is that majority of the people in a game are COD fanboys who drop to hotspot areas such as Hacienda and in the first 5 minutes of the game, half the players are dead. This makes the player density quiet low in the mid game and can get boring unless. To get some action you have to drop in the same hotdrops as everyone else, so the problem repeats. PUBG should fix this.

Sound is absolute garbage in this game. VERY loud vehicles, guns and bombs. I have to set my volume to low in order to avoid hearing loss. It's that bad. However that makes footsteps almost impossible to hear. They should fix that.

VERY buggy, UNOPTIMISEd piece of crap. 1 year old bugs still arent fixed. PLENTY of Chinese hackers. Developers do nothing to ban them. 

Overall, i think this game is very much worth the price, however developers seem to be incompetent to fix their game.  GREAT concept and fun, but poor execution.

I can see why people are angry by this and sure it's not a great solution, but it is only temporary. They had said that it will be a while until it's back but so be it. Some of the people complaining about it also brought up the fact that there is nothing to do in PUBG, well, let me throw this at you. What's the point of CS:GO, H1Z1, Rainbow Six Siege, any other competitive shooter? What's that? To win? Nothing else? That's what I thought. It doesn't matter which competitive shooter it is, there is no ""goal"" other than to win each battle, play competitvely, or rank up. There is no ""goal"" in CS:GO other than a higher rank, which may I state PUBG also has a ranking system, Rainbow Six Siege has no ""goal"" and the said ""goals"" that were brought with Outbreak were only temporary and awarded you with cosmetic stuff. People are also complaining about the microtransactions. I've got something for you too: you realise that they are COSMETIC and have no real effect on the game itself? It's not Pay to Win, it's not going to change the game for you, so who gives a damn whether or not you buy crates or that the crates cost money to open? If you want skins, you can pay for them, they're cosmetic. 

That's the end of my rant, but for those of you wondering about the game, it does have its issues serverside, optimization wise, the physics are a little wonky, but considering it's based of its Arma 3 predecessor of the same developer it makes sense that some of the physics react similarily to how they do in Arma 3 (Occasionally you would drive into a tree and your tank would sommersault into the air and explode when landing back on the ground), if you have a decent computer that can run it though, it's a really enjoyable game. It's fun, fast paced, and after 200 hours I have the same, if not more, push to keep playing, it's pretty addictive.

But if you're okey with that, I highly recommend it. The game has got a very rich content of weapons, attachments and natural or urban structures which make many different tactical possibilies

A lot of people complain about the optimalization, but the point is, you cant play a late 2017 game on a potato. The real looking details are harder to process than cartoony grafics. Plus, frequent updates are present to even improve the performance, so more mid-low class gaming computers can run it.

The updates also very frequently bring more even new content (new guns, recent addition of many grips, vehicles, third map) and so there is always new and newer stuff added all the time

_Easy-to-use user interface with simplistic options
_Different time-limited event modes (Metal rain, Team Deathmatch, Tequila Sunrise, ...)
_Easy to learn, hard to master
_Not PayToWin, skins are only cosmetic and you can stop wearing them at any moment in the game
_Currently still developper supported (As of 4/22/2018)
_8 km² maps (with a new 4 km² upcoming)

Cons :
_Only 2 maps as of now
_Split up community (Newbies, Tryhards, Pros, ...)
_Bad vehicle control and optimization (seriously, bump at 5 kph into a rock and blow up)
_Bad optimization in general (Map not loading when landing, having trouble with older graphics cards, ...)
_Servers are often ""Too busy""
_Most chinese cheaters come to EU/NA servers

Conclusion : If you do buy PUBG just to chill with friends, or to play to win, you're making the right decision. Although, the developpers are very active, the game is still quite buggy (vehicles freaking out, parachute sloppy controls, ...).

I bought this game back in August of 2017.  I had known about it for several months but decided to hold off on it as I wasn't ready to get back into the multiplayer shooter genre.  My Youtube channel ended up switching over from Clash Royale to PUBG.  I now livestream PUBG 7 nights a week on my channel as a full time job.  I have about 1200 hours into the game with probably over 200 wins, although I do not keep track of my wins.

THE GOOD:

Many years ago I was a competitive Halo 1 multiplayer gamer.  I lost my interest in being a competitive gamer because there wasn't really any shooters I felt addicted to enough to put in that kind of time and commitment.  It can be very frustrating and you can lose a lot of sleep because of practice marathons.  CS/GO was the only shooter that I had thought about getting into, but was already worn out on that game from the original CS mod for Half-Life.  PUBG has reinvigorated my passion for competitive gaming.  The graphics are realistic.  The variety of weapons is awesome, with new ones on the way.  The bullet drop feels realistic (coming from someone who was a Gunner's Mate in the Navy).  I'm also a big fan of the overall military feel of the game.  You get such an adrenaline rush from knowing that you can't respawn and that once you die the match is over for you.  My heartrate still gets pumping everytime I'm in the top 10.  I love the fact that I can play with my friends in squads.  This is my favorite mode to play in.  They also have Solo and Duo's you can play.  I'm happy they added an FPP mode as well, as third person feels clunky, unrealistic (due to third person peeking), and slow.  They now have a third map Codename: Savage that they are working on and seems very promising as I have played it both times they've made it live on their Closed Experimental Server.  This game has a lot of promise and could potentially become the next big Esports game.  One in which I would love to compete in professionally.

THE BAD:

1.0 Release came out in the middle of December 2017.  Unfortunately, the game still has a lot of the same issues we've had since I've been playing it.  And still feels like an early access game to me.  Most of the problems and bugs the game has you don't see in typical AAA titles when they come out with their 1.0 full release.  The game still has major desync issues, mostly I believe to be caused by the Asian players that come onto the North American servers.  It could also be that the developers never expected the game to be so record breaking and are having a hard time getting enough servers to accomidate the millons of players they have worldwide concurrently.  It becomes very frustrating to peek from your cover and shoot someone, then once your back behind your cover, you get shot and die.  Sometimes I will shoot someone out in the open with my reticle right on them and not hit them once because they are desync'd/lagging so bad.  This is unacceptable to me given that it's 2018 and I have very fast cable internet.  Also, because I live so close to one of the NA servers.  Sometimes the desync/lag feels so bad, that I think it's worse than it was on Halo 1 when I played that competitively 15+ years ago.  This has been an issue since I first started playing the game and only seems to be getting worse.  There has been an outcry by the community for the devs to put in a region lock for many months now.  At first the creator, Brendan Greene, called the community a bunch of racists and xenophobes.  Which was incredibly insulting.  Then about a month ago they said they would release a region lock soon, but we have yet to see it come to fruition or hear about their progress with implementing it.  They supposedly released a soft ping lock in the game, but yet I can still hear Asian players over the proxy chat while in game.  Although, these Asian players could be using a VPN to fool the servers into thinking they have a lower ping than they really do.  Am I starting to sound racist myself?  No.  I feel this way about the Asians, because Battleye (PUBG's anti-cheat software company) itself has released statistics that 99% of the cheaters in the game come from China.  This is another issue that I feel the PUBG team DOES take seriously, but they are not stern enough about.  Most competitive multiplayer games have an extremely stern anti-cheat system in place.  So much so, that they will implement a ban mid game.  And typically it's an IP ban.  I have never seen so many cheaters in any multiplayer game as much as I have in this one.  This could be because the game is so record breakingly big.  It could also be because of the monetized skins available.  My game still does crash from time to time, although it is not as bad as it once was, so I feel they are making progress on that.  It crashes just as much now as any other AAA title I play does.  I do get some wierd FPS drops on occassion, more so on the test and experimental servers though.  The FPS drop frequency varies from update to update.  I feel that the desync/lag/cheater problem would be greatly reduced if they simply followed the successful actions other AAA developers have taken by implementing tougher anti-cheat, like IP banning, or even Steam account removal/limitation.  Implementing a region lock will greatly aid in this as well.  One thing, which I feel isn't much of a big deal is I wish they would add weather back and allow for map/weather/time of day selection.  I don't mind the desert map, but when you get the desert map 15 times before you get the original Erangel map again, gets a bit frustrating and boring.  I feel as though they will be bringing weather back as they have been testing it on the new Savage map.  I think people kept leaving the Fog map before because the fog was so thick that you could hardly see anything.  I think if they just tone it down a bit people will enjoy it and play it again.  Finally, some of the playstyles you see in the game can get a bit frustrating.  I like to either land far away from the plane alone with my squad to loot comfortably and then go hunting, or drop into a hot location just so that I can get into fights and warm up a bit.  One of the things I loved about this game is that they had a blue zone that pushes the players together to prevent camping.  Most aggressive/competitive players would agree with me that camping is a boring and not a fun way to play.  But, there are still players who will camp in the corner of a building (even in FPP mode), without peeking, just to wait until they hear your footsteps and shoot you in the back.  It makes no sense to me that they are so scared in a video game, A VIDEO GAME?!  A video game is meant to be fun.  It's not fun to me to sit in a corner and just hide the whole time.  I'll never understand why people do this.  This isn't necessarily something Blue Hole can fix, as it happens in every multiplayer shooter game.  So, I can't blame the devs for this one.  People will also try to fight with you outside of zone not scared of the blue zone.  They buffed the damage by the zone, but people still do it.  I think they need to make the blue zone more damaging than it already is to discourage this.

CONCLUSION:

This game is a great game overall, despite the issues mentioned above.  It's incredibly addicting and one that I feel I would want to play competitively in Esports.  Once the issues are fixed and come out with a real 1.0 release (one that is polished and bug free), this game has the potential to be a 10/10 game.  Just like Perfect Dark and Zelda: Ocarina of Time were back in the late 90's.  The game is only $30, which is half the price of any other AAA title, which I feel makes the game worth it.  Even though I joke on my channel when I'm having a bad night and say I don't recommend the game, I definitely do.  Buy this game.  If I can get over 1200 hours out of a $30 game, that in my book makes it a must buy.",1524063894,1524063894,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

It's a great way to relax or to play competitively. This is a game for people that want to play more competitivly and more seriously rather than what fortnite has made with its community and fan base. I see PUBG as a game to be taken a lot more seriously.

It's fun with friends and also on solo as long as you make it fun. I myself have spent many hours playing with my friends and messing around. Not only that but I have spent a few hours playing with ex pro ChosenZygote (Calvin) and a few others.

I've heard people say it's boring however I have to disagree, it's only boring if you make it boring. Drop in a big area and try kill as many as possible, make it fun. This game can become hugely more entertaining if taken seriously.

With fornite recently growing massively and becoming such a popular game it's hard for PUBG to compete. My best advice to the developers is to make it free to play or at least half the price, however though it really is hard for them to make these kind of changes because the community would not take it lightly with so many people paying full price for it recently. 
I know there are many hardcore fans out there, I know some personally and know there are many more out there that should be supporting this game in its rough spot.

Summary of this mess of a review, is that it's a pretty good game and doesn't deserve the hate it has been getting. Good luck dev team!",1523319317,1523319317,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

bought this game at launch and refunded it within a few games to being soo broken (warping through walls, parachutes not deploying etc)

bought it about 6 months later in and it was fun and alot more polished.

now in late 2019 the gameplay itself feels very solid and stable. everything works as it should most of the time.

the only thing that makes it hard to recommend is the chinese are ruining the game. if bluehole can figure out how to keep them on the asian server and make aimlocks easier to detect (and no stupid temp bans) it might be get back to #1 on steam leaderboard. 

The desync abusing laggy server jumping cheaters make it frustrating at times. if we can get rid of them this game will be my favorite game on steam

mechanic adds a whole new layer to Fortnite strategy wise, but the military aspect PUBG brings a different feel. Fortnite 
definitely is a lot easier than PUBG, but does not make it a lesser game. 

I suggest if you are going to play this game for the first time, see if one of your friends have it and team up with them.
The steep learning curve of the game can prove difficult for newcomers and can put people off the game easily. Teamwork
is also one of the best parts of this game.

The game is very awkward to run, and I sometimes have issues with it, with my GTX 1080, Ryzen 7 1700 and 16GB DDR4 3000MHZ RAM. It can be off putting but you do sometimes get a good night in where it doesnt bother you.

This game is very enjoyable for the hardened player, if you like strategy or multiplayer games, its a must!",1519902600,1519902600,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

If you don't have the newest PC hardware, I really do not recommend this at all, you are paying $40 for a game that you can't even play. 

If you do have a rig that is powerful enough to run this, then by all means, it's a fucking awesome game, with great yet simple task, find gear, hunt players and be the last person standing.

Update:

This game is insanely addictive, if you want to play without cheaters you really have to play on Asian servers. As, there's no incentive for the Asians to cheat on their own servers, they're not using the game as a micro economy in their country. The real quandry is that 99.9% of cheaters are from Asia, however, they also account for 46% of Blueholes playbase, while the US only accounts for 12% of the playebase and with skins being a cash cow for Asian farmers -- the cheaters are going to go where the money is (US/EU) servers.

Bluehole has implemented the infamous BattleEye anti cheat, however, just like ARMA 3; it's proved to be completely useless against monthly pay 2 cheat providers. As far as I've seen in its early implementation: BattleEye just complicates the process for your everyday user, creating a plethora of launching, match making, loading, and other various issues, keep honest players out of the game.

I can never tell if I am improving in those types of games, and though I can often point out a reason for losing in my own play, I can't help but feel as if some of it was out of my control. PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS eliminates that struggle, making it easy to see your improvement, and removing frustration in teamplay. Though PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS offers team based play, It is not nearly as frustrating as other games. If someone dies on a squad, they just leave and start a new game. With the inclusion of solo play, when you lose it's nobody's fault but your own. Almost forgot to mention that the gun play is fantastic, not too easy like C.O.D, and not too brutal for newbies like CS:GO.

Where do i begin. After playing countless hours through all stages of the game, I have come to bring friends, family and even enemies to play this game. Either for team mates or target practice. I have stood by this game and not judged or said a damn word publically about the horrible state of the game, because for me the fun was worth it, that adrenaline hit when your in the final 10, final 5 and even in the last one on one I have never experienced before to that degree. Oh my god when you win? you feel like your on the top of the world. You JUST KILLED 99 MOTHER****ERS AND CAME OUT ON TOP! Safe to say this game is extremely enjoyable, and deserves its place on the best sellers list and on the lips of every twelve year old who wants mum to buy the next big thing in gaming. I understand how the studio feels, I understand the immense pressure that has been placed upon them when all of a sudden their pet project, glorified half broken mod blew up and became what it is today. Since then the community (including me) have been begging for more content, more this, more that, fix this and fix that. So what have the developers done? Done an EA and put microtransactions for cosmetics (which is like every other bloody game these days so they get a pass for that) they add new guns, new locations, fixed the map, fixed the guns and how they fire, even added a NEW MAP OMFG GUYS. But wait, oh its another map where it can be exploited by those who have an easy time going through the coding and finding ways to exploit the game. BUT GUYS BUY THESE KEYS YOU MIGHT GET A COOOOOOAAAAAT.


This game has lost its focus, what was an incredible experience has now been ruined by hackers, cheaters and the barely held together structure of the game itself. YES I understand that a game this complex with 10,000,000,000 players (over-exaggeration) is not the easiest thing to fix. But for the love of **** the development studio would have made millions upon milllions upon millions of dollars, how hard is it to hire more people, SPECIFICALLY to combat cheaters and another team to target the games optimisation? Hire twenty people for each team to fix this now stale and aggravating experience that I used to crave playing the second I finished a 12 hour day at work.

First off, Pubg is a great game alone or with friends. Play Alone against 100 people, or play with anchor friend in a duo game against fifty teams of two or play squads with two or three more friends in squads with twenty-five teams. The game begins in starting area that you are thrown into with your friends and other players. Then you are thrown into a plane that flys over a map, then the back of the plane opens and then you can jump out or wait to jump, when you jump and pull your parachute the battle royal begins. You have to find a weapon based on your RNG luck, kill other players that landed  with you or you die. Then you repeat the whole process of the start area and then the plane. This is the replayablity part of the game. Each game is different from the last, you can drop so many kills or die at the beginning. This does get tiring after awhile of doing it but it’s how they match make their players into the game. There is a lot more to say but it will take up the whole review. I love the gun play in this game the looting for medical items helmets body armor and backpacks, ammo guns and scopes. The odds
Are really stacked against you in this game. I have won 7 games total. One solo, one squad, and five duos. It is so rewarding to win because it means you were the best out of 99 players or 49 24 teams. In total pubg is the best game of 2017. I love playing it and will continue to play.

I know battlerounds isn’t the first game to use the battle royale formula, but it seems I chose the best executor of the concept. When I first bought battlegrounds, I had no expectations. I had around 1,600 hours in CS:GO, and wanted to play an open world survival game. I read that battlegrounds was more of a shooter than a survival game, which, at the time wasn’t what I wanted. I watched a few videos and read a few reviews detailing the mechanics of the game, and thought “eh, this sounds fun and novel enough to spend $30 on.”

600 hours later and I’m finally playing my other games (I stopped playing Witcher 3, Divinity: Original Sin 2, Prey, CSGO). I will probably never play CSGO again as Valve doesn’t take care of their hacker problem, and I played CSGO since the original game’s beta, which I installed from a PC Gamer disc sometime around 2000. With Bluehole enforcing a 1.5 million player ban for cheating since PC 1.0, I’m hopeful that they will manage their community better than valve ever did. 

For the most part I find the community in PUBG to be okay. As a comparison, CSGO was filled with racism, sexism, xenophobia and bigotry. It wasn’t uncommon for people with white supremacist names to be spewing bigotry. I’ve had to team up with a fair number of bigoted players in PUBG, but they are easier to deal with because if I don’t want to play a match with someone, I can back out without a penalty. Also, a nazi thrives on stupid people supporting their bullshit inflammatory statements, so when they don’t have someone backing everything they say and actually have to use reason to argue, their argument falls apart. Or you can just make fun of them for being a nazi: the choice is yours. As far as trolling goes, I’ve encountered that only in random squads. Every so often you end up hitting a squad that has two really intentionally annoying players or someone who wants to drive everyone into another squad to be killed. Duos, people are pretty cooperative because it’s a little awkward to be an aggro asshole when it’s just you and your teammate and nobody else to witness the LOLs. I’ve met a few solid steam friends through duos.

As far as looting goes: the game is pretty shallow here. There is no crafting. It’s a matter of figuring out which guns work for you, finding them, and finding your preferred mods. I’ve won games with very little loot and I’ve lost games level 3d out with suppressors on my AR and sniper rifles. 

But looting isn’t what the game is about really: it’s about teamwork and working with the terrain to gain an advantage over your enemies. Enemies on the hill behing a house getting shot at by guys you don’t see inside of the house? Run up during the firefight and clear the house or wait in ambush for the team to loot the bodies. One thing you learn quick is to not engage everyone you see. You’re here to survive, not get kills. Let your enemies do the work of killing for you, as you have no stake in which team lives and dies in a skirmish. And wounded players are a few bullets less you have to waste.

While you may develop favorite places to drop and find yourself in a regular loot cycle, where the circles force you to move is what keeps the game dynamic. You may start at the same place in two back-to-back games, but be forced to move in opposite directions for each. When the circle gets small, tactical decisions like “should we take the house at the center of the circle or the hill at the edge?” Become a matter of critical importance. “Goddamn it, we should’ve gone dead center to the house while we had the chance” is a pretty commonly used phrase that I cap a failed game with.

Gun mechanics: there are more realistic weapon ballistics than instaclick games like CSGO (sorry to make the comparison, it’s just the shooter I have the most experienc with). Understanding bullet velocity/drop and weapon mobility are all important. What you click isn’t always what you get. This makes the game more challenging in my opinion and I like it. 

I’m annoyed that maximum foliage isn’t a mandatory thing as the game would be so much more interesting if you could hide in the grass. Most players turn it to its mimimum value, so hiding in the grass is useless until the final circles.

Vaulting can be clunky. I’ve vaulted off a 3 story building when I was just trying to jump onto a ledge and landed right down between two enemies I was trying to get the drop on (but not like that) a few times and needless to say, that’s incredibly frustrating. 

Anyway, go buy the game. If you haven’t tried it by the end of 2018, what kind of gamer are you even, sweetie?",1515164292,1515164292,True,3,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I landed on school:
Spotted a bunch of naked kids with shotguns spraying down their enemies like they stole their PS4 and limited edition Minecraft. Killed them, got their stuff, went out of school

Thought to myself ""lets hit the road the zone is pretty far away lets go"", Proceeded to get in a car and go. found someone similar to Tachanka from R6, He started to spam my car with a DP gun and level 3 helmet. My car just told me fuck off and die. I jumped out, flew to a roof because I'm fucking jesus. Killed Tachanka, Tachanka called my mother a ""Babushka fucker"" I said ""whats wrong?"" He replies with yelling in repeat ""Stroganoff!"" then disconnects

I'm way to far over ground to jump for my healthbar.
I wait for 20 minutes to see if the circle spawns on me. It doesn't. Just misses actually.

I then watch my fucking computer screen as my game freezes, It unfroze a second before a flying dirtbike just hit my head and killed me.

-With the new update, the new map keeps being picked. It's not a 50/50 chance between maps. Kind of a shame but whatever, I imagine/hope this will get balanced eventually.

1) needs a lot of optimising as we get better performance in games with higher graphic requirements.

Second: I've played this game Every Chance I have, and this is just an All Around Greeat game. I've played all the way throguh the Early Access of this game and even played the Test Servers. This is THE FIRST GAME That has ever went from Early Access to Full Lunch on Steam for me. In the Time line that they set All the way too the completion, and ""They are still working on this game"" it has been Amazing. This game Like Many other Game Titles that Are or Have become AAA does have it's ups and Downs. 

Let's Start with the Cons... As I like to Start with Bad news then End on a Good Note.
1: It still Lags when you have a Full 100 Man Lobby. This Stops with-in 30 Seconds of Landing...
2: You still Run into Hackers I've ran into About 15 my WHOLE TIME PLAYING (Currently Have 290.4 Hours on Record and this will Grow.) Also what AAA Title Doesn't have hackers? AKA Sore Losers who can't win a single game they Play EVER...
3: Still Has a few bugs but Not Game Braking.
Thats all my complaints.

Now Let's Move onto the Pros.
1: Love the Gun Play, and Gun Sounds.
2: Combat can be Fast and intense (Only Game that Really Gets the Adrenaline pumping for me.)
3: It's Fun as HELL to play this game with Friends and play it Solo as well.
4: The Vehicles in this game (1) Sound Good, (2) Feel Right when Driven, (3) Seam to be Very well Blanced to One Another.
5: The Developers Listen to What 95% of their Community wants. The other 5% Are Either Idiots, Cry Babies, Or Hackers.
6: When The Developers say they are doing something, It gets done, and NOT HALF ASSED!!
7: It's Priced Well...So Well infact That I went out and Bought it for my Xbox One, Yes it's Still $30 there too.
8: IT IS NOT PAY TO WIN THANK FUCKING GOD. It Takes Some Skill to earn a win even if RNG Bites you in the ass.

In conclusion The Mixed reviews are just that: An Opinion Like me, or of someone whom had either an Amazing Experience or a Piss Poor One. I Love this game and Can't wait to see what the Devs come up with Next for this game. Don't just Go off of my Opinion or someone elses to see if you will like this game, We all Know it's a 100 man Battle Royle and you're not going to win all the time every single day of the week. You need to play it and have your own Experience to Truly form an opinion on this game. Now get out there, and Game on!!

Heart-stopping moments and unctrollable shakes afterwards XD. 
UI is made waaaay better than the early access.

After watching YouTube vids, I always want to jump in and do something crazy like 300m snipes with a crossbow.

You can tweak the settings in the settings menu if your PC is struggling, as with most games. I don't play it every day and I don't expect it to keep me entertained 16 hours of everyday the next 5 years. In PUBG I expect and want a challenging but most of all fun experience to play with friends. I expect there to be bugs and issues in an early access game,  if there wasn't then I would've been suspicious, since that is the reason a game isn't officially released yet. I also expect and accept issues and minor bugs in a released game, I expect new bugs to be introduced along with patches, I understand that a game is an ongoing piece of work and that unless the developers locked in current features forever and only focused on having a bugfree game, it won't be perfect ever.

If you have the same expectations and desires as me then I think you're going to enjoy PUBG in its current state. I've had some great fun so far, every of the 46 hour I've spent so far on this game has been exciting, and if the game died right here then I still would've considered my investment good value. 46 hours of joy for 30 euros is not a bad deal in my eyes, I'd pay 30 euros for just 5 hours of joy, I'd pay 300 euros for an hour of joy if I felt like shit. 

PUBG is a good game, for me it is way up there on the list of awesome games. It is the first of its kind that I truly have enjoyed, and I expect to have a lot more fun coming out of my 30 euro investment, so I am very happy with my purchase. 
I would give it a 10/10 despite the fact that I can find flaws if I really want to, but I don't care about technicalities, I don't care if the game ends up being unstable or laggy for a week, I'll play it next week.

Pros:

-Very good gun mechanics (ballistics/animations)
-Car mechanics are good (handling/suspension)
-Community is quite something, in a good way
-Maps are very different and diverse for different types of fights
-Being able to squad up with a friend or multiple
-Bugs are a plus when they're funny

Cons:

-Not optimized for lower quality computers, only get if you have met requirements, new 10 series Nvidia cards or new radeon graphics are highly recommended along with kaby/coffee lake or Ryzen processors and at least 8 gigabytes of ram
-Bugs are a plus when they ruin your 20 minute looting spree of cities that no one goes to (I'm talking to you Zharki)
-Could use higher tick servers
-Although most gun mechanics are good, there are some unrealisms that some people are starting to care about. (Winchester not having the bullets move the piece of metal into the tube, primers not being struck after being ejected, The over and under shotgun not moving over the lever when opening the action, some guns attachments aren't very possible (SKS and AK have gas systems that need to be removed in order for a suppresor to be attached, being able to attach sites to a gun made in the late 1800s (Kar98k/DP-28) but not a Winchester, and many more, just tedious things
-Some rubberbanding issues

Overall:

If you have a quality computer and like shooting people and messing around with friends, get this game. Yes, you'll get mad at this game, but it is worth all of the entertainment you will get out of it.",1514260736,1514260736,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

-Realistic BR gameplay

-Extremley fun with friends
-The adrenaline You get from winninig and the satisfaction is beyond anything I have ever experienced
CONS
-SOLOS can be a bit boring
-Huge RNG factor if dropping in popular places
-Long waiting time jumping from one game to another
-Match can last up to 40 minutes
-Majority of games on the Miramar map will make You frustrated as You spend 20+ minutes looting and running around without seeing a single person just to get shot in the head from miles away

In conclusion I would resommend the game to anyone who likes BR games and the satisfaction of winning is really something else. Although I don't like the new map I hope the devs find a way to fix it.

Before the official game release, the game was so baddly optimized, im glad they changed all that.

The gameplay is pretty fun and interesting once you play a few games... Its easy to learn and its a 40% based on luck (its mostly luck about what drops and attachements you get really).
It is also a fun game to play with friends (1-4 on Squad) but it can be sometimes frustrating.

I've had a lot of fun playing it both alone and with friends.
The gameplay can be very diffrent and you can often choose what kind of game you want to have, If you want to have a lot of action, you drop in a location where you often find enemies (Cities, large complexes etc.) If you are one looking for more of a quiet game then you just try to drop at a more remote location.

The various guns are quite skill based as they have unique spraypatterns and that rewards more experienced players over new ones. Saying this doesn't mean it's impossible to win a game just because someone is better experienced than yourself.

The randomness of the game has two sides. It makes every game a bit diffrent and you can't always play the exact same way. If you find a sniper for example you probably want to get some distance from your enemies when engaging. And if you only find an SMG it's the opposite. This also makes the game a little unbalanced as some won't get barly any loot, and some will be stacked after just a few minutes.

Overall, if you are fan of the BATTLE ROYALE genre this is probably one of the best ones out there right now.",1513847594,1513847594,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Recently, I have seen a large amount of chinese players on the american servers, which is quite frustrating especially considering that many of the cheaters in this game are from china. There are also many bugs that occur when driving, especially on the new map, there are many times my car will get hitched on something that isn't there. There are many hackers ruining the game right now, but from my understanding they just sent out a pretty big ban wave, which is nice to see.

Overall, this game has many fantastic experiences and moments that I'll remember for a long time, I recommend this to everyone that has a decent computer (the experience is not great on a low grade desktop.) The few things I'd like to see happen to this game is that they continue to support it; add more content; and build upon it, they region lock china specifically, and they continue to optimize and fix the game's bugs.",1513833659,1516576862,True,3,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Devs have made some mistakes in the process, but overall they have been active, responsive, and dedicated to making the game great.

About the price $30 seems reasonable because of all the features and high player count, so finding a match will take no more than 3 seconds on anyday.

-Some of the buildings in Miranmar had a lot of weird pixel walking capabilities
-Server can't handle 2,3+ Million people playing the game
-It's a pain in the ass to invite people into a squad , half of the time they are busy or showing up as offline in-lobby

Sure, they'd add a new gun once in a while, but it would usually be put in the crates, so it isn't like you'd even really use it that much. They didn't add anything really from August to now. Granted the new map is coming out, along with its new weapons, but I think that the damage may have already been done. Playerunknown's Battelgrounds has become stale. It's as simple as that. People are sick of the repetative mechanics, lack of content, not to mention the optimization problems everyones been crying about for months and they evidently can care less. PUBG had its hayday, but it is going to decline. I was surprised to see it still at the top of the most popular game tab, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it slowly decrease down that list. For new players, I definitely reccomend. It is a lot of fun, but don't main it as a game.

this game is absolutely,brutally honest in a way that is fun
40% of gameplay is being shot at by a sniper from go knows where
The rest= running and scraping a handful of kills together.
The concept and controls are well constructed, optimisations is okay 
And combat feels smooth. Although custom keybindings are recommended
 Beyond what other salty players would persist, this game is great, little to no bugs other than the cars occasionally flipping and spazzing, this game brings new and exciting ways to die and or succeed in combat that is Adrenalin inducing TO THE MAX!!!!!
Outfits and character customisation is quirky and the best aspect is the ability to make decent amounts of money off this game marketing crates for dough on the steam market.

It had one of the most compelling stories I have ever experienced. The anime girls were well fleshed out characters, that I really cared about. You may be wondering why I have over 100 hours of gameplay in this game. Simple answer is because of the beautiful, plump, juicy, tender anime tiddies in this game. This game is actually not a thrid person battle royale shooter, it is actually a compelling romance visual novel that will completely blow you away, you will be playing this for countless amount of decades like me. I've been playing since the year 1943 where I was in afghanistan on the front lines fighting against the murderous psychotic nazis. But this game has saved me from all the horrifying experiences I have ever had, on the front lines of WWII. This game has stuck with me till now, my wife who is actually a body pillow loves this game. I do not like real women, because they do not understand me like body pillows do. Me and my wife sakura chan played this game for countless hours on end , because we can relate so much to the main character and his shocking past where *SPOILERS* His mum and dad both died from a terrorists attack where they were taking a holiday in russia *SPOILERS* I could relate to this because my parents got gassed by the Nazis, and Sakura chan had her parents killed by a terrorist suicide bomber in a basement of a hentai store in Japan, where I found sakura chan when she was buried in the rubble and aftermath of the bombing. I got her out of there and have been caring for her ever since. Many tears have fallen from our eyes because of this game. Few years later we married, because of this game we have bonded so much and fallen completely in love with each other. The characters in this game made us so heart wrenchingly sad, because me and my wife connected so much to them. There are approximately 25 endings to this game all with different out comes on all of them. This game is very detailed and well made and it has made me a WWII veteran, and full grown man shed tears everytime I played. please do check out this game as it is a masterpiece and has connected with me on a very personal level.

Chinese players can't understand half the American Enlgish speaking players and vice versa, no one has a good time in the end. 

Do not get me started on latency, I have shot and watched these people walk through building - disappear - take 10000 bullets - lag out - etc.

We get it, you don't want a huge media disaster, ""PUBG VIDEO GAME CREATOR HATES CHINESE PEOPLE!"". 

Let me tell you this, a step by step guide on how to not lose all your playerbase as NA is not the only victim, check out EU too.

1) Stop being a cuck, it's not racist to try and balance a game based on language compatability.
2) Add some sort of region locking system, yes it can specifically be for the Chinese as they have 10x the amount of players.
3) Do it FAST.

I have had over 30 friends switch to games like Fortnite and even, dare I say, H1Z1. SOLELY so they can communicate with other English speakers.

You are fucking up your game, you are fucking up your fans, you are fucking up the future of video game politics.



If it wasn't for us, the players, you would still be PLAYERUNKOWN and not a big time hot shot. Fix it before you lose what you've worked so hard for.

[h1]Pros[/h1]

I do like the bare concept of the game. 100 people drop into a map scattered with gear and the name of the game is find gear and eliminate all the other players until there is only 1 remaining. The ""Winner Winner Chicken Dinner"" at the end of a game is also pretty nice. The game is quite good visually. I run a GTX 1050 on a Dell Inspiron 7000 and have no issues with the games sounds or graphics. The UI is quite easy to navigate too. The weapons are realistic and gun damage is pretty consistant to each particular weapon. Bullet drop adds an extra factor into shooting as you cannot shoot someone from 500m away just by aiming at them unless you change your zeroing distance. The game is also great for people to spectate too. Twitch streamers have blown up with popularity while playing this game. Not to mention the E-Sports community that is building in popularity too.

[h1]Cons[/h1]

After playing over 100 hours of PUBG, I can say that from a technical standpoint, this game needs alot of work on the back end.  Server stutter is a real big problem. You get behind a tree, you've been there for at least half of a second and then you pop back out from behind the tree because the server didn't catch up. Not to mention the irritation of not being able to use voice chat because chinese players leave an ""open mic"" on all the time and all you hear is the background noise from their gaming cafe they are in. Like 250 voice all yelling at once in a foriegn language is rather annoying, so I reccomend just muting the ""All"" voice chat all together. Another BIG issue they seem to have is with hackers. Alot of American players are calling for a ""Region Lock"" of the chinese players to keep them in their own servers, and I can't say that I blame them. I'm still not sure why they decided to allow players to play on other countries servers. It isn't good for connection quality and not knowing the language just makes for a bad play environment. The hackers jump from region to region for reasons I do not know, but I do know that PUBG does not seem to take this issue as seriously as it's playerbase.

[quote=Brendan ""PlayerUnknown"" Greene]Yes, the majority of cheats come out of China, but that doesn’t mean all Chinese players are cheaters. This idea that just because you’ve got a few bad eggs, you’ve gotta ban a whole country is a bit reactive.[/quote]

No one is claiming that ALL chinese players are cheater but, from my expirience, of the chinese players that are not cheating, they are screaming in broken english about how america should die, and that how ""China Number One"". 

Another issue I have with the game is that you cannot add people to your steam friends list after playing a random que duo/squad game. If I meet someone, and they are a decent person and a good player, I'd like to add them to my friends list, but I can't within the game. I have to ask them for their steam ID, tab out (which often crashes the game all together) and open steam to add them. It's rather more complicated than it needs to be. 




[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

PUBG is a visually stunning game that still has quite a few issues to resolve if it wants to stay at the pinnacle of steams Battle Royal charts. With free games like Fortnite allowing players a better expirience for free, I'd say the only thing keeping players to PUBG is it's realisting look and strategy. If PUBG could fix the issues I've seen and heard about, they could be a real contender to be at the top for a long long time. I don't see how a company worth BILLIONS, with a B, can still be facing these kinds of issues when there are games out there that are far less valuable in terms of how much money they make and how many people they have working for them making games with a better expirience on the technical end and clearly listen to what their players want. Just seems like Bad Form. All in all as of now, I'd give the game a 6/10 and would recommend it to people who would sacrifice overall expirience for visual realism.",1520975779,1520975833,True,2,0,0.543743431568145752,0,True,False,False

Hello ya'll! At the time of The Steam Awards 2018 Nomination, I wish my comment can have some little effect to make PUBG greater!

As for me, some fixable problems exist in the current environment, and solution could be simple: 
 
1. Take action against the sale of cheating program, cut the problem from its source.
2. Fix Bugs and Physics to guarantee user experience.
3. Keep improving gameplay. Release something fun for gamers and make Esports matches better balanced.

At last, Mr. Bluehole, it's not all Chinese users' fault like global fans complained. 

You know exactly what was going on, right?  

So please make effort before it is too late.

The only reason not to purchase and play at least 100 hrs. is if you really hate the Chinese language or the Chinese people.

Although classified as a survival game, this experience could also be considered a looting game with really beautiful scenery and peaceful, calming sounds of nature. The RNG of loot really makes each game unique, and there could always be some sweet new loot behind each door. There must be thousands of rooms in each instance of PUBG and each one is its own little treasure chest to be discovered. Loot is everywhere on these huge 30 square-kilometre maps, just sometimes not the right loot you are looking for.

Ultimately, each looting session must give way to the barbaric shoot-outs and desperate ambushes as the map randomly shrinks in and damages everyone outside of the circle. At this point, it becomes absolutely necessary to have good gun handling skills and also the tactical awareness to know whether to hide, run or gun. The semi-realism with ballistics and damage is refreshing and makes for some of the most intense PVP experiences that I have personally felt since playing Diablo II in Hardcore mode. Intense. I'm talking 130 beats per second pulse, sweating hands and actually forgetting to breathe kind of intense.

Life is precious in PUBG, and that makes kills feel more like murder. But getting the skills to get the kills can be a real challenge.

For the first 100 games I had a jpeg image of the keybinds on my second monitor, just to be able to get the hang of the controls. It's very much the same control system as SQUAD (Project Reality) but somewhat easy to forget in the sudden gun fights that happen. After finally getting the basics down I started doing solo speed matches dropping into the heavy zones such as the Arena in Pecado, Prison, or La Hacienda. These are bloodbaths that rarely last long for me but great for gaining combat experience.

Wait times in-between games can be very quick, which is a good thing unless you are trying to get in a quick bio-break. Queue times are non-existent - there are many, many people playing at all hours. It's basically 45 seconds and you are flying into the zone. Dying can be very frustrating but at least it takes no time at all to get onto the next match and the search for fresh new loot and sweet gear combinations begins again.

There are a few horrible things about this game, let's be real.
1. Although 1.5 million accounts have been banned and more cheaters are caught every day - because it is a client-based system it will always be susceptible to the shady, shady dudes who are savy enough to code their own exploits. There is a reporting feature that apparently works. After 200 games I have detected at least 10 separate instances of  someone absolutely cheating. I'm talking about 100% for sure cheats with headshot kills through a house from a very far distance and another guy who snap shotted me without a scope from 300 metres even though trees were covering me on the kill-cam. Frustrating but mostly quite rare.
2. If you are trying to play in Duo or Squad to play with teammates during certain hours you will most certainly have Chinese speaking partners who probably do not know many English words. I personally feel it's a really cool cultural exchange and I'm doing my best to learn a few Chinese words but it is not ideal. Why so many Chinese players are on the North American servers may be one or two reasons. They may be abusing the netcoding because it favours high-latency players or they may be farming items which have real world value to sell on Steam - either way, many players see this as a negative gaming experience and are demanding region-lock. I personally feel that fixing the way the netcode deals with high-latency players would address the root problem.
3. I have often queued for a squad game yet I enter the match alone. [/violin sadly plays]. Not sure if my teammates are dropping queue or if I'm just being put in solo-squad to fill out the server numbers.
4. You have to have a beefy gaming-rig to handle the CPU/GPU crunch when dropping into a congested zone. Even the beastiest of PC's can have a hard time and experience some chuggington as soon as the parachute is cut and you hit the dirt.

That's the worst of it. I've made a few Chinese friends on Steam and have had some great platoons so if you are friendly to the Chinese they are almost always friendly back. Only in one game did I have a team of Chinese squaddies who I felt killed me just for speaking English. Remember, the only North American languages are ones like Navajo, Cayuga or Mohawk - English and Spanish comes from England and Spain so easy with the Xenophobia bros.

Holding down alt and having a free look option is a small detail that puts us one step closer to Virtual Reality as an entry point. Driving vehicles is a very entertaining mini-game. Graphics are very nice and seem next-gen to these ol' eyeballs. I think more updates could improve the sound. For example, no matter what surface you are breaking on, some vehicles make a rubber screeching sound, even on dirt. URRRRRKKSSSS - right on the grass.

But if you monitored MAC addresses and the computers activation keys to your cache of banned suspects it would really put the hackers out of the game for good unless they felt like dropping a few hundred to change any all of those. with the ISP gateway IP still being marked as well.

Also it feels like one of your latest few updates has significantlly bogged down my performance in game from 240fps in lobby and 120-140 in game to basically being locked in at 60 no matter what.

With each update comes something new that enhances the game and makes gameplay increasingly more fluid. The guns are all pretty much balanced (there could be some tweaks here and there). The RNG in the game either is heavily in your favor or heavily against you such as when you drop in a town with your friends only to find micro-useless's and P92's, or if you have to play marathon-runner to get to the circle (THIS IS A YUUUGE PROBLEM WITH THE NEW MAP!!!). Vehicles are mostly realistic and have truly come a long way since just this past summer when i started. Overall rating 7/10, but unless you are really picky or you are really bad at the game you won't realize it is anything below 10/10.

[h1]The BIG issues:[/h1] This game is riddled with hackers, specifically from asian countries. These guys join the lobby and instantly start shouting ""CHINA NUMBER 1"" or some similar chant but with a different country, that is basically a key indication that you have some hackers in the lobby. Good thing is that you can usually beat them if you out flank them and don't expose yourself. Most of these hackers can either shoot through walls with hip fire, instant head shot, destroy gear with single shot, use super speed, instant death by grenade without cooking, or fly. I haven't seen the ones that fly, or the ones that run as fast as a vehicle in a couple months. It is very easy to identify hackers now that we have the replay feature, so if you think someone is hacking you can record the clip and report the player. I think there is an option for further reporting that you can use the video clip of on the player unkown website. Hackers only really ruin 9 out of 10 games, the one game they don't ruin is because they messed up and got out played or the circle killed them. When I first started this game my buddies and I could win a couple games in a row or at least play more than 5 minutes without getting killed by a hacker. Now it seems you get into a game and as soon as you land you'll die from a pistol head shot through a wall from a guy half way across the city hip firing. 

[h1]THE FIX:[/h1] Region lock countries and it will fix most hacking issues for North American players. Most of us just want to play the game with our friends, act like badasses, or just troll. Most of us our sick of playing with people from another country who yell ""F*** America, America number 0, China number 1"" while hacking to kill us effortlessly and then t-bagging our dead bodies. This is what needs to be done if an anti-cheat system can't be enabled that solves until there is a solution that solves the problem.

[h1]FUTURE SUGGESTIONS[/H1]

To end this I would like to suggest that in the future there be a feature for purchasing/renting, or self hosting servers. I think it would be a great addition to the game especially for those in it for the e-sport aspects of the game. This would open up a lot more local tournaments. Also, please consider adding different options for each map such as larger teams, and more players on specific maps. The new map definitely could be a 200 person map. 

Another suggestion before I wrap this up, please add a map that is smaller but made only of cities.

[h1]2019 Edit[/h1]

Game is still riddled with hackers, some new and good things have come along since my initial review.

Now the sad stuff. First, the addition of locked crates require you to get a $2.5 key to open what is most likely a half cent cosmetic item. Second, a new event pass thing pulled straight off Fortnite but actually costs a lot more. What's next? In game advertisements for real world products?

PUBG is the best thing that could’ve happened to us in a loooong time  so next time before u talk smack think and ask urself... “If I really hate this game and am tired of bad devs, why do I even bother crying?”  

And you whiny entitled cucks should stop complaining about the game not being perfect... Look at what ur getting from a team of ppl that went all in to bring you the game you loved but didn’t really think through that UE4 was never built to have 100 ppl running across a different maps filled with weapons and everything just for your gaming pleasure, the game will never run like cs go or league, so you cucks who think complaining about fps will solve something think again, if ur game doesn’t run well it’s your problem and not theirs... They’ll optimize the game but it’ll never be running like butter unless they change engines. 

Bluehole is doing as much as they can even though you guys fail to realize building and working on pieces of codes that make a game played by millions of players a day is definitely not an easy task and you whining will not help. Support the devs and stop being so negative, we don’t want our game to end up in the gutter just like csgo and many other games did.",1526550444,1526550444,True,2,0,0.542073488235473633,0,True,True,False

NOW, if i must start to count since the final release, then, this game isn't really doing much to improve itself.
Having only 2 maps, the good russian one we all know and love and the half-assed new sand map which came out as the 'main map' for the final release, a solid gameplay, nice graphics and sounds, and a really good king of the hill experience, PUBG starts off as a great game, but it gets boring the more you play it, once you know the maps, develop a smart gameplay approach, won enough times, and if you're like me, don't really care much about customization, which seem to be one of the big points since release, with players grinding points to sell the loot boxes, then you'll be eventually tired of this game.
It's not a bad game, hell, is a really fun one, i still find myself having a blast with it, from time to time, but it's not a 'main game' or something i would find myself playing everyday.
Gameplay-wise it still reminds me of ARMA/Battlefield, with an inventory management system and loot, sweet, sweet loot, added to it.
Playing with your friends can really enhance the experience, unless your friends are 'lone-wolf' wanna-be assholes who always die first, alone, and bitch & try to tell you how to play for the rest of the game.

PUBG is a great game, mostly, as long as you dont live in Australia...... if you do live in Australia however, PUBG corp has given all of us the middle finger here in the great Down Under, there are no servers and no support for PUBG players here, and when there is a server up and running theres a time limit on when you can play, (max a few hours in the afternoon),  it is also restricted to 3rd person squad and Solo squad modes. No 1st person option available (my preference) which is highly dissapointing

PUBG has displayed utter disregard for their community of regular players here in Australia, and i assure all of you that there are plenty of us here in Australiua who enjoy PUBG as their ""Go to"" Battle Royale title. i have put in nearly 900 hours into this game and love it to bits, but as of now I have NO faith in PUBG corp to sort out their title for us here in Australia. The ridiculous high ping to US servers is unacceptable, constantly hitting upwards of 250, ruining the game experience for everyoone

Truly dissappointed in the developer for their lack of giving a crap about their player base here. I hope they fix this simple problem.... bring back the servers in Australia 24-7.

TBH PUBG is a game worth playing, I love it and i do recommend it to evryone who likes BR, unless you live here in Aus.

ill see you on Vikendi (hopefully)

- You need at least a fucking 1080TI to run this game...
- Cheating/Hacking is STILL a problem!
- Don't play it before bed, or your sleep will be terrible.

- Terrain feels wonky...

Thank you for trying your best, this game is great.

But i have a suggestion i would like you to take into consideration, like in h1z1, the combat zone, why dont you create a combat zone, where we can practice, warmup, and have fun before we start playing the real ""solo, dous, and squad"".

It would be really awesome if you do that.

Please contact on me on my email address if it is possible or if are you thinking about that in the future.

I always loved PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Yes, there is lag sometimes and the game is still being optimised but it's unplayable as most people claim it to be. I never had major issues with this game.

After having played PUBG for more than 100 hours I can still say that it makes a lot of fun. I bought it for only 30 bucks and it provided me with great fun. I don't regret buying this game. I can't wait for future updates.

It has its aspects of a crappy free to play mobile game, such as the really bad loading screen artwork, the battlepass, etc., but I'm enjoying it like I did years ago. As of writing this, there is currently no map selection, but I understand why. It was impossible to find matches when I tried playing again a while back, when the choice was open, so I hope they can find a system that works well.

As per usual, this game has its fair share of bugs, but I still have fun (most of the time)

There is clearly still a problem with cheating, although I don't see it much in the eastern US. Currently, the top players on the leaderboard are mostly obvious Chinese grind accounts, which I would assume are sold for money.

Still desperately miss the old menu music, but the current one is better than their other attempts.

A lot of the cosmetics that they have been creating lately haven't been half bad. Plenty of rugged clothing items and skins, which is good to see.


For better or for worse, this game isn't quite what it used to be. Plenty of game-breaking issues have been addressed, and while i may miss the way I got to play this game back in early access, it's good to see that they're trying to shape this into a proper game.",1567104257,1567104351,True,2,0,0.538461565971374512,0,True,False,False

First; thanks GOD for that the company finally optimizied the game (of course it need's more optimizing, there's a long way to a good game), it's a real mess at the beginning!
Shoot and aiming is different from all the FPS games that I played, much more realistic, so if your a CoD, BF, CS or another FPS game, don't expect to be a good player here too.
It's very depending on ping and if you have an upper ping of 200, completly forget this game and stick to another BATTLE ROTAL game.
Of course it need's SSD beacuse of heavy buffering load.

I love the exhilarating fights, the gun mechanics, and the feeling of winning though.

At launch, PUBG is noticeably improved from its early access days, but frame rates can still fluctuate inexplicably. Even a high-end PC can have trouble maintaining a consistent framerate with relatively modest graphics settings, evidence of PUBG's ongoing optimization struggles.
Likewise, the familiar fear of seemingly random crashes and connection difficulties remains, and it's sometimes almost as unnerving as an opposing squad converging on your location. (If it's any consolation, you can pick up where you left off if you relaunch the game before your character dies.) You may also experience character models clipping through the environment and getting stuck inside objects. If and when these problems strike, an otherwise good match can be ruined in an instant.
PUBG's technical shortcomings can undermine its broader achievements on rare occasions, but they don't override your desire to continue playing. Each phase of a match presents a different type of tension that is equal parts thrilling and terrifying, driven by the insatiable desire to be the last person (or squad) standing. Whether you play solo or in a group, successfully executing adaptive tactics to win intense, high-stakes firefights makes for an incredibly rewarding experience. Every player has unique stories of their most memorable matches, and even after hundreds of hours, PUBG continues to inspire rousing tales of victory and defeat.",1518898208,1518898208,True,2,0,0.537366509437561035,0,True,False,False

I've seen the horiffic rubber banding of the 1.0.0 release. I know of the speed and aim and instant kill hackers. I lived through the M4 meta. I've gone through periods of only playing solos to grind the leaderboards, and playing squads with discord servers dedicated to setting up squads, and just playing random squads because I need to relax. 

PUBG is not a perfect game. It is not an ultra realistic Mil-Sim. It is a fun game. I will compare it to APEX legends because they are both BR games I have experience with.

Apex legends is fast paced, fun, a bit cartoony, and smooth. Movement is quick, and aim is king. The voiceless communication system works really well. It plays like a BR version of overwatch, both due to ultimates and abilities, but mostly because of movement similarities.

PUBG is a game with good gunplay, good team communication (in randoms a lot of people use mics and use them correctly. People are often helpful, but sometimes people are not. This is the way of people.) and huge maps. Compared to apex I forgot how you can just die to zone because you took too long and couldn't find a car.

The map variety on PUBG is great. The map balance and weapons balance has improved considerably over time, and I haven't died to desync once in the past couple of months. This is all with a good connection on US servers, so results may vary, but matchmaking algorithms have been nailed down fairly well and random no longer drops you in Sanhok every time.

I haven't seen many cheaters (or even one) in the past month or so. Probably because there is less financial incentive/there are new games out to cheat on (apex I'm looking at you).

PUBG's UI and interaction and movement feel far clunkier than APEX, but way better than Arma or similar games. It is a functional balance of realism and gameplay which can take a couple matches to get used to, but is worth the additional interaction capabilities and general 'realism' vibe of the game.

Bullets feel deadly. except for the PP bizon. I'm really bad with that gun. But getting shot or hitting someone feels correct. the melee is garbage. Apex's melee is way better. Any other melee in any other game is more consistent and usable.

You can solo wipe a squad. People are not bullet sponges like they can be in apex. Positioning is important, and if a squad member is killed, they are gone for good. Staying together and communicating is key. You can hide in the grass and pray no one finds you. Sometimes you can be looking for people and see no one for twenty minutes. It's still fun for me. Finding good loot feels good. Getting a kill feels good.

Vehicles are way better than they used to be, and better than many other games (not the best, not driving sim material, sometimes they get collision messed up and get stuck in a fence and explode, but like 3% as much as they used to.)

Generally, balance is way better than it used to be, positioning matters a ton, and good aim is necessary, but lightning reflexes aren't essential. Gun play feels good, and pacing is inconsistent, but feels like it should be that way.

If you aren't patient and just want combat, you likely want to just play sanhok all the time. If you like looting and sniping, Miramar may be the map for you. Erangel is a nice mix. Vikendi is a denser erangel, and snowy, with a lot of house/building based fighting. Urban combat still feels less reliable than positioning based distance engagements, but you learn from your mistakes, and figure out when combat is the best option, or when that lone target in the middle of the field is better used as bait for other teams, and not worth giving your position away for.

The microtransactions and crates and all that don't matter in my opinion. I don't feel the need to spend money on cosmetics when the reason I play the game is for the uniquely well made semi-realistic battle royale experience it provides. I've made some good friends playing randoms, people I still talk to and catch up with who I met a year or more ago dropping Hacienda and Pochinki.

The leaderboard is a bit meh because it primarily tracks how much you play, instead of how well you do. But again, that doesn't detract from the engaging (and significantly improved and balanced since release) gameplay which makes this game the most played on my account.",1555802204,1555802204,True,3,1,0.53586500883102417,0,True,False,False

All of the negative reviews of this miss the main point.  There may be a few bugs or fps drops but if you aren't trying to be an esports hall of fame twitch streamer you'll have fun.  The worst part to me is how great scopes are and how much of an advantage that is.

The biggest issue of this game is that it's arma stripped down.

It looks like arma, plays like arma, and only has some ui improvement and slightly better mechanics then arma.

Otherwise you can get arma 3 and play pubg mod, dayz mod, gta mod, tons of other mods, as well as arma.

The instant queues because of the massive player base is the only thing that really separates this from arma.  If 6 million people bought and played arma 3 there wouldn't be much reason to play this.",1522653154,1522653154,True,2,0,0.535308599472045898,1,True,False,False

Really like what the game is starting to turn into. Devs have done a good job with the patches and adding new features, honestly they just from here on just listen to the reviews from people and improve it from there.

It has dominated the steam charts for months and has attracked dozens of popular youtubers and twitch streamers. Although, the feedback from people have been negative, pubg has maintained a stable player base till early january. Now, PUBG is loosing players. I will try my best to conclude why.
Why is PUBG ""dying"" ?
Firstly, I shall begin by the in-game reasons. Then, secondly, the decisions taken by the game developpers.

        As we can see, for many people, PUBG is a game rigged with bugs, glitches and un-balanced assets. The game itself is quite stable compared to others, but still, bugs appear, and for a company that is now worth over 60 million USD, bugs that appeared from the beta must at all cost not be shown in a ""released"" version of PUBG, that  includes the buggy matchmaking system, being stuck between objects and even minor ADS bugs. Equally, PUBG has a serious balance issue. I personnaly find the game reasonably balanced: weapons, player health and even map terrain; is balanced accordingly. But sometimes I can see why people say that PUBG is un-balanced, as an example : 4<5 shots to kill someone without a vest is ludicrous and unrealistic. And of course the shotgun spread mechanic, some accuse it of being broken.

        So, what is Brendan Greene and his team doing ? A wealthy game company should in theory keep the game in a stable state. Of course, many players are leaving PUBG for the actions taken by the team: Instead of fixing common issues, patches are focused on adding useless features, for example: they have changed the U.I for the parachute indicator multiple times, recently, they also added the plane's trajectory. I find that PUBG tries to focus players away from common issues by adding these features. Many people find PUBG uses ""patches"" to introduce crates that must be payed to open. I personnaly find this greedy and insulting to the remaining community, instead of creating new maps, new weapons and accessories regulary, they create ""cosmetic"" content that we have to pay to keep us occupied: it's just disgusting.


      Finally, PUBG has had awesome feedback. But is slowly dying because of a lack relation between players and developpers. A buggy and un-balanced platform and a oblivious management team.

[*] The game is unique in the sense that its gun mechanics are on point and satisfying to use.
[*] As of late, the game's engine seems to be running a lot smoother compared to when the game was fairly new.
[*] Gun sounds are distinguishable for both your own weapon and the enemy's
[*] PUBG gaming community salt level: 2/10. Only rarely will you encounter somebody that is toxic. Report system seems to ban such players on the regular. Eg: Players that intentionally team kill.

[h1] NEGATIVES [/h1]
[list]
[*] Movement mechanics and moving around the terrain in general feels super clunky! Quite frustrating to end up being shot because you were slowed down or stopped by a square piece of grass that hasn't been clipped properly. 
[*] Jumping or vaulting onto obstacles such as a large rock is also super clunky!
[*] It may seem like you are clear to shoot someone over or around the cover you're behind, but quite often your bullet ends up hitting that object.
[*]  Developers seem to focus their attention on adding cosmetics to the game rather than fixing core issues such as players who are cheaters. (Aimbot, shooting/driving through walls, 0 recoil) Though there are far less cheaters compared to the early days.
[*] Most cheaters or toxic players I've come across seem to be from China. Just an observation!

I haven't played a whole lot lately, but all these complaints about hackers...? Sure, I sometimes question how someone managed to kill me, but to my knowledge I have never encountered a hacker (in EU servers). Neither have my friends.

I do see a problem with the whole lootbox system, but 1) it's there since the early stages of the game, so why are people bitching now and 2) it's not pay to win. It's gambling, which should be illegal in most countries and distracts the devs from further development. That does not take away that PUBG is still the ultimate Battle Royale experience, as is.

To explain that, I refuse to turn this into a fancy review explaining what I approve or disapprove of in regards to Graphics, Gameplay and Mechanics and more. The point is that this game did what DayZ did not. What H1Z1 could not. What Fortnite still cannot (though being hugely popular with the younger audiences). And what many other games including your common casual shooter can never achieve.

It's a shooter with reliable shooting mechanics. It's easy to get into, but will require some degree of skills to master. It has quite a lot of variation and randomness compared to other games in the genre. Controls are fluid as is operating your character in the world. There are third and first person options depending on your preference. In fact, they made the game more competitive by adding so much more attachments and scopes that everyone is bound to get a feasible build for the late game these days. These devs started out with a winning concept and finetuned it perfectly so far.

Basically this game has the formula right. Something that very few modern games manages to reach. Do not for a second trust any of the negative reviews, which are all written out of spite for supposed hackers or the whole lootbox situation. The only thing I dislike of Bluehole is the fact that they have arbitrarily banned random players without evidence, but have let offending streamers off the hook because they are promoting their game. That and lootboxes are the only gripes I can name and neither have an impact on the foundation of this game: the perfect gameplay.

If you are dying for a proper Battle Royale shooter to play with or without your friends against other people... this is simply the way to go.",1526514555,1526514555,True,4,0,0.534008026123046875,0,True,False,False

4. Dumba$$es who say ""JUST OPTIMIZE YOUR GAME"" without actually realizing how long and how much effort it takes

My first 400 hours on this game were before 1.0 when I could barely run it and had to wait 5 minutes prone in the grass because none of my buildings were showing up. This game was just so fun that I could ignore that. The adrenaline rush I get from getting a good kill or outplaying a team was well worth the low frames and frequent bugs. Now with 1.0 out I could even raise my graphics settings. The devs obviously put effort into maintaining this game consistently fixing any major bugs and problems that come up. 
Now for the hacking problem. In all the time I've played this game I've run into less than 20 hackers total, and they usually come in waves then disappear soon after. This only applies to the US since the asia/oceania servers have legitamate hacking problems where people pay top dollar for subscription hacks. But for the US, most people who complain about hackers are honesly just bad at the game. They can't see the difference between their dumbass mistakes and an aimbot. For the US players out there I can say for sure that hacking is not a big problem.

Recently the new ""map"" has been introduced as of last month and it's nice that the Dev. Team is constantly updating the game, although there are soo many things that they could fix to make it a much more enjoyable experience.


CONS / PROBLEMS:

-People that aren't playing on their servers by location.
-Has terrible optimization compared to some other games.
-Pistols are nearly completely useless.
-Driving in the game is extremely problematic when all the cars slide around like the ground is ice.
-Weapons of the same caliber have completely different stats(bullet drop, range).
-Entities fail to render in for some people which leads them to die to another player that lacks the same issue.
-leaderbords are completely inaccurate.
-Bugs that allow you to be completely compromised for the whole game until you die exist(mainly in the new desert map).
-The list goes on with each match played.
-No Hitmarker noise or screenlocked indicator, it is indicated by one of the enemy's kidneys exploading into a ""bloody mess""



PROS / NON-Problems:

-Bullet drop is fun and challenging, also the game has ""Zeroing distance""
-Fights that break out betweeen multiple squads over objectives like supply drops or moving into the next zone are heated, tacticle, and enjoyable(exept when encountering bridge campers, yes it is an effective strategy but..... it's unfair forced engagement).
-Everyone can have a favorite weapon in the game, there is no weapon in the game that is complete S*** It's all opinion based(except the pump action shotgun and the 7.62mm Revolver(meme pistol))
-Silencers make you feel like an assasin
-Winning a game is just as or even more satisfying than eating Tide Pods(depends on your current mood)
-The realization that the Tommy Gun's description was lying sent me into a soul searching journey for 2 days; during that time i found out that i have two sons that are 18 and 17 years old, one named Bicheal and one that is transgender or something.(The moral was that the game lied to me and i was heck'n SHOOK)
-I have learned that the only words that all chinese players know in english are ""No"", ""China"", ""Numba"", ""one"", ""Bye bye"". Exclusively in that order too. (take with a grain of salt please, it's hard for me to learn a 5th language with all these heathens in my good christian life)
-You can pretend to be a ""Mormon Converter"", simply go up to a house, knock on the door with your trusy bullet-proof frying pan and then convert them by force.


----------------

P E R S O N A L   Q U A R R E L S :

SQUADS:
-Squads needs to be improved, i know that it is logical if someone dies they have to spectate but quite frankly it is the most boring experience in my life when you get killed by another player with a fully automatic Mini-14(because macros=win in this game) at the begining of the game because you landed in a large building which had a beanie and a P1911

-Queing up on the NA SERVERS for squads with matchmaking because your m8's are offline and you get matched with 3 other players whome all greet you with ""Ni hao"".

-New map gave me and my entire discord server an addiction to Tide Pods(or those cheap ""Great Value"" knock-offs)

The game itself certaintly has work to make it better, but for a game that needs to handle so many servers at once, it's quite a respectable feat. TBH im surprised my game hasn't crashed as often as I assumed would happen.

[list]
    [*]Really fun, especially with friends
    [*]Encourages team work and communication
    [*]Ever increasing community

[u] [b] CONS [/b] [/u]
[list]
    [*]Not optimized properly, you'll get low FPS even if you have a good rig (I personally get around 70-80 FPS)
    [*]Increasing amount of cheaters and hackers
    [*]Stream sniping b*tches
    [*]BUGS...lots of small bugs that are annoying as f**k

[u] [b] VERDICT [/b] [/u]

Is this a fun game ? Hell yes. Is it worth the 30 USD price point though ? No, period though. I recommend either getting the game when it's fullly released and polished, or if it is on sale, otherwise hold on to your cash. But, if you are thinking about it, and you have money to spend, this is definitely a get-it. 

Also, a note to the developers - priotize the small bugs and FPS issues, THEN look towards introducing new features and porting the game to other consoles and stuff.",1512896543,1512896889,True,2,0,0.533073961734771729,0,True,False,True

So as everyone knows PUBG dropped onto steam like a nuke, just demolishing everything out there and smashing gaming records and amassing millions of players in mere months. The hype was insane and nobody could get enough of it, everybody wanted more! But thats just it. Everybody wanted MORE... But nothing more was coming... It got stale and old quickly, then small patches managed to break the entire game to a point where players started losing hope. That's when I picked up my copy of PUBG hoping that all of the negative was just people finally getting off the hype train... Boy was I wrong I played merely 4-5 hours before I totally lost hope in the game and thought to myself ""there goes 40$"" and i gave up on it for months.

   Fast forward to 2 weeks ago when I had gotten wind of a new map, battlepass, and apples to say fuck you to Fortnite, I laughed and said ""Fuckin' hell, guess ill give that game a try again"" in preparation for the new update I got back on and gave it another go, and to my surprise the game actually felt slightly less bugy and a little more playable then I had previously remembered, and for the first time I was actually thoroughly enjoying PUBG! I started watching more and more footage of the new map and was genuinely excited for the update. I couldn't wait! 

    Now we arrive where we are today. The release of Sanhok, the battle pass, and seemingly some optimization and slight gunplay tweaks (Correct me if I am wrong though) And I have to say that this is the first huge step in a new direction for PUBG co. THIS is fresh new content that your playerbase has been screaming at you about for a year now! The game actually feels fresh and new. New weapons, scenery, sound tweaks, AND APPLES! No more updates of more Microtransactions and new skins and bullshit nobody wants. Continue listening to the people keeping your game in buisness and your game will last for eternity.

                                                                           SUMMARY
  PUBG has been notorious for a lack of innovation and a lack of concern and care for their playerbase and what they want. BUT now it seems they seem to understand what is going on around them and how their multi-million copy celling game is failing. They released an amazing update. The gameplay on Sanhok feels new and fresh. This is what we've all asked for guys. ITS HERE! If youve given up on PUBG in the past. This is a new beginning if they continue on this track. 10/10.

As an American user, I'd prefer to play with people from my region; people who speak English and have similar ping as me. There is nothing more frustrating, besides the hackers, than being killed by a person who is lagging everywhere and yelling ""China number 1"". VPNs could still be used to get around a Region Lock, but on top of Region locking, being involved in a game with players who have similar ping will defently resolve my issues.

I'm not going to deny the fact that the developers were wrong during the early stages of this game (game release date onward). It was clear that they weren't focused on fixing the game itself and more so focused on generating revenue through ingame purchases. However, you have to understand that BlueHole was originally a company that made cellphone games. So, ingame purchases is pretty much second nature to them. 

I understand people are upset about this but too much of the current and former player base are being too salty about what happened. If you weren't so salty and have been following up on patch notes- you can really tell they have changed the direction of their developers. Yeah, they made the pass a purchasable thing but you don't HAVE to buy it. Why do people complain about ingame purchases when you don't have to buy them. A lot of people are ignorant and believe that a one time purchase can fund an entire company forever is rediculous.

IMO PUBG deserves more positive ratings because they shouldn't be judged on their past. :)

I used to get ~100 frames with similar settings but AA and Post-Processing: on very low. But recently, I've tried setting my graphic settings higher and I still maintain high fps through the entire game. 

TL;DR 
Game used to be really buggy aka rubberbanding
Game has been optimized
Runs smoothly (sometimes slight lag in extremely crowded landing areas)
Devs are focused on fixing the game
I love this game i hope more people play it :D

Now and again I still have issues like random crashes or servers that grind to a halt with massive packet loss. Cheaters are rare but still exist. A large amount of players in China still connect to North America servers which leads to desync still being an issue, but this is minor in comparison to how it was just a short while ago.

The netcode/optimization issues are finally being listened to a little bit, but i personally feel with the money they have made most of those problems should be fixed by now if not perfected.This most recent update basically changed the game completely. Just when everyone got used to the last update they drastically changed things again. Now micro transaction? We all saw this coming.. It's only a matter of time before that one big BR title is going to come out and swallow PUBG whole. Fortnite hurt numbers bad enough as it is.

With that being said though, and the player base still somewhat holding strong. For the price I say it's worth it. It can be thrilling and fun, but also raging and toxic.

The first time I played the game (the day of the release), I remember that I had that feeling, telling myself, ""this is huge"" .... The last time in my life I had a such great feeling was the first time I played Counter Strike (Alpha version) back in 1999, I told myself this game is special. Ok, to be honest, I may have told myself the same thing the first time I played GTA... But honnestly, I haven't played any game in my life that much I played Counter Strike, and I am quite sure that PUBG is here for a long time. 
What I love with PUBG is that I can run a game in solo whenever I want to play, and I don't need to rely on any third people... Random teamates use to be a mess... I love even more when I play the game in squad, with some friends, and that's what initially loved in Counter Strike, the team play.

The two maps are 8x8Km and start with 100 players who drop in with only the clothes on their back. More maps will be released including a 4x4Km one.

   I first played PUBG when it was still in early access and I was absolutely thrilled to play a game where the length of your weapon counts and suppressors don’t lower your damage. Mechanics such as bullet drop, bullet penetration, and leaning (peeking) are also present. The damage model is a bit simplistic. With time the game got a much better netcode and it’s a lot more optimized, but it’s still not very good. I love that they added the option of double tapping lean (peek) to make it toggled. Another thing that I really liked, is that there is another fire stance besides the classic hip fire and ADS, where you just hip fire more accurately while trading away speed. But even now you are being forced out of ADS when you get too close to objects like walls, door frames, etc.; I think, at the very least, there should be an option to just prevent movement instead of forcing you out of aiming when there is no room to move. The way maps are deigned works well for PvP, but it’s very nonsensical and look unfinished. Vehicle physics is still wacky. Gameplay wise it’s not that exciting, except maybe if you get in the last 10, or 3. A lot of matches will be you running around for 15 minutes, ending when a player gets the drop on you or after a short firefight. Time to kill is very low but it can be increased a bit with armor.

 Rating: Chicken, chicken, this game’s not the winner.

I originally owned the game on an Xbox One X, but it was an absolute mess playing it on that. The game was locked at 30 fps and crashed constantly because it would overheat my Xbox. Also, you can imagine how difficult playing a game like PUBG is on a controller with no aim assist. Still, I had a ton of fun playing it on the Xbox and put around 150 hours into it on that. Playing on PC has been spectacular though. Playing it in 1440p at around 110 fps is a night and day difference to the Xbox. The visuals might not match some other AAA titles, but they are close. It is good to see that Bluehole is still refining the game by adding new weapons and switching up weapons like the M16, UMP, and Vector while adding the MP5K.

This game is great, or it has the potential to be incredible. the game play is great (apart from the flying cars and lack of cars, just my opinion).

But this game is massively infuriating, imagine just waiting for a game  to start and then you're stuck with a black screen and then you have to close the game then open. Dont even get me started on the damn lag when im jumping from one crate to another and i end up on the ground and find myself punching my screen. but despite all these faults and infuriating flaws which the developers take a damn long time fixing, despite all this I can't help but recommend this game because its brilliant. So rewarding, so hard to master and when you pair up with someone its just hella fun or if you want to take on the world alone go for it, even more rewarding. so i should'nt recommend this but i have to, its simply too much fun (but don't get me wrong this game is hella broke).",1525029691,1525029691,True,1,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,False

It was just the right kick to get me back into the game. After many deaths due to unbalanced gameplay. The game itself does FEEL like a full release game. Menus are flashier, Menu theme actually sounds like music, and the new map brings out new playstyles from both new and veteran players. 
The one thing that makes me still very angry about this game is the lock on custom games/private games.
You might be saying ""But wait, you can join other custom games right?"" 
Technically yes, but im saying that if its going to be a full release, why is it that I cant make a smaller custom game for just me and my friends to play on? Why is it that the PUBG Partners are still the only ones able to make locked 1v1 custom games. There is no real reason from the dev as to why players cant access custom/private matchmaking from the release of 1.0. So until that feature (FINALLY) gets added to the public. My review will just be a 4/5
Why?
Because sure, the game is still fun to play, 
but locking out a function of the game when its supposed to be the ""Official launch"", just makes me feel like this is still an early access game. 
However, with that asside its still very much playable, and still does give me alot of enjoyment. So I will still recommend this game to others.",1513869662,1513869662,True,1,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,False

Yeah we cannot choose the map, and the desert map is the most frequent now, but we got to assume it is because, the glitches on the map need to be detected as fast as possible and fix 'em.

Pros:
-3 Maps
-Hillarious community
-Good servers
-Great Graphics
-All in all very fun (Best played with friends)

Cons: 
-Occasionally Still buggy interface and main lobby screen
-Sometimes it takes a while to get matched. Depends on where you live / what time it is

To be honest thats all.
PUBG is and will be the greatest RB game atleast for the next couple months or years.
The ""Fix PUBG"" campaign Blue company started after they realized how broken the game was at around April 2018 was a great success and Really gave top improvements in all ways to the game
I would 10/10 buy this game again if i had to.
Enjoyable and perfect for timefilling.

1. There are several diffirent regions/servers but still the chinese players are everywhere.There's a specific server that says China but still they join into other region like Europe/NA etc. 
PS: this is not racism for bringing 
     out the problem of this game.
2. Because of many different people are changing trough servers and regions there are alot of cheating and bugs exploits 
    that Bluehole can't fix. 

 Why am i recommending this game:

1.  Fun to communicate with people you've just met
2.  Fun to play with your friends
3.  Many coincident funny moments and alot more.

The physics and gameplay mechanics feel great, and it has a stealthy, tense quality that many other battle royale games lack. That kind of slow-paced, very intense gameplay is why I play and love PUBG.

However, the developers have...strange priorities, to say the least. That the game still runs this poorly so long after its EA launch is absolutely unacceptable. The microtransactions are un-fun and useless, all the skins are boring, and the event pass is honestly insulting.

But again, it offers an incredibly fun kind of BR experience that is hard to find elsewhere right now.

If you do buy this game, understand a few things:
1) It is very, very difficult at first
2) It will likely not run great on your computer if you have anything less than an i5 6000 or Ryzen and a GTX 1060/RX 480
3) You will have to put up with unpatched bugs and terrible optimization for what appears to be the life of the game.

If, like me, you can accept these faults because PUBG is such a unique battle royale experience, then you will have a great time. If the realistic feel isn't as important to you, or if you have no patience for bad developer choices, there are far better BR games available.",1531093600,1531093600,True,2,0,0.527008116245269775,0,True,False,False

[u]GRAPHICS[/u]

Visually PUBG is pretty impressive, even on very low settings for all graphic options the game still looks clean and well designed, players blend into the environment making for a tense and thrilling ambience especially in the closing moments of a game. what makes PUBG the best battle royale for me is the less cartoony feel you get playing it as opposed to other games in the genre such as fortnite and H1Z1

[u]AUDIO[/u]

If i had posted this review a month ago my conclusion would have been needs some help. but now after some changes and seeing the further improvments on the test server i can safely say to you the sound has been polished to a reasonable standard now, cars sound like cars and not a french guy snoring into a vaccum cleaner, you can now more easily distinguish were the hell you are being shot from rather than hearing a shot come from in front of you when it is infact behind you, all in all the sound quality has improved and its a welcome improvment.

[u]GAMEPLAY[/u]

Until you have been killed by a naked pan weilding maniac blaring ""All Star"" through his mic you have not experienced this game to its full potential. the tense combat moving from cover to cover always wary of that fucker somewhere 400+ meters away with a kar98k and an 8x scope taking pop shots at your half hp no team mates alive ass is what makes this game amazing. there is a reward to be had for playing any way you want also! fancy hiding from fights and ambushing people? go ahead! you'll get less loot but you will make it to the top 10 spot more often than one of those nuts rushing into the centre of a warzone to pick up that extra loot and armour. All in all this game is Broken, Unoptomized and Buggy as heck but sometimes thats what creates the magic and i love it!

- Bugs, such as your parachute catching the side of a building oddly, dropping a couple of feet and losing half of your health. 
- Playing on a NA server and getting non-english speaking squad mates -.-

'PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS' é um jogo em formato 'Battle Royale' onde o objetivo é único, ser o último a sobreviver. Enquanto você tenta sobreviver, você terá que encontrar equipamentos, armamentos e objetos de cura para ajudar-te na batalha, que consecutivamente você terá que matar para sobreviver. Explore o mapa gigantesco enquanto o gás/raio faz a área diminuir para juntar os jogadores sobreviventes em uma pequena área para a batalha final. O jogo conta com vários veículos para ajudar na sua locomoção, desde carros e barcos.
PUBG possui também o modo ""DUO"" e ""PARTY"".

Duo: Você e mais um jogador farão uma dupla para tentar sobreviver.
Party: Você e mais três jogadores farão uma equipe para tentar sobreviver.

Além disso tudo, PUBG também possui o esquema de salas customizadas, tendo como jogar o modo ""Zumbi"" e um modo onde pode-se ter uma equipe de até oito jogadores.

O defeito maior do jogo é a renderização e otimização do mapa, é constate quando alguém está jogando e se depara com as estruturas não estando carregadas, isso para alguns, pode ser que seu inimigo que caiu perto de você já tenha o local carregado e pegue uma arma e te mate, não dando chance para você.

They have paid attention to fan inquiries regarding the adjusting of weapons, they have renovated previous weapons accessories like scopes, they added new weapons, vehicles, maps, modes, rehauled the main menu interface, fixed bugs, glitches, etc. and people still find a reason to complain or cry about the game not exceeding expectations.

When I first heard of Battle Royale, I was instantly interested. PUBG was my first Battle Royale, and today it remains the only Battle Royale that I consistently play and that can keep me hooked. When I first started playing PUBG, I was instantly drawn in. Getting into the end game and realizing you have a shot at winning is a feeling like no other -- palms sweaty and all of that. The brutal realism of this game just makes it unlike any other. Unlike Blackout, Apex, and Fortnite, making a mistake is extremely punishing in this game. Positioning and discipline is everything, not just raw skill. The guns and armor are incredibly balanced, unlike other games. I can't explain how frustrating it is to go against someone with gold armor in Apex and know that you have barely any chance. The low TTK in this game makes it unlike any other Battle Royale. 

Despite what other players may say about the playerbase diminishing due to bugs, lack of features, or cheaters (all of which are in the best state they've ever been in), I think it's more that the playerbase stabilized. Like I said, this is an extremely punishing Battle Royale. Especially if you don't have a squad to play with, mistakes are very harsh and the people that are still playing this game in mid-2019 are very experienced. I've been playing this game since it was in early access in early 2017, and I can say that it's harder for me to get a win now than it was a year ago, because of the players that are still around. This game was what kicked off The Battle Royale craze, so a lot of people purchased this based on hype rather than intense research on whether or not they would actually enjoy this or not. Surprise surprise, a lot of people didn't enjoy it, and the player base actually dropped, as most new releases do.

This game is definitely not for everyone, and of course my experience with this game is subjective, but this is my favorite FPS of all time. The gunplay is extremely well-made, every aspect of it. The recoil, the looks of the weapons, the noises, the gun playing this game is simply better than any other game I've ever played. Four maps all of which are a different size and different terrain give this game a lot of variety. It's pretty easy to meet friends on here too -- even if you are a solo player, you can meet some great people in duos and squads. If you can get over the learning curve, this is truly an experience unlike any other, and this game is around stay for a very long time.

On one hand, the game has it's fair share of problems. Vehicles bug out and kill your squad, people shoot you from behind walls, textures don't load sometimes, the game is rampant with hackers, the devs have a penchant for being greedy.

On the other hand, it's still so much fun, and there's no other Battle Royale experience like it, especially with friends.

I've tried plenty of Battle Royale games, H1Z1, Totally Accurate Battlegrounds, Fortnite, but none of them hit the feeling PUBG gives me. The bad stuff nearly doesn't bother me as much as you'd think when it boils down to it. The game doesn't require additional purchases to play (not that I'm advocating a cosmetic-only system in a game that costs $40 already), the textures not loading and people shooting through walls happens maybe once in 20 matches for me, and you can use the buggy vehicles for some pretty dumb things.

There's the feeling you get when you win as well. Maybe I just get it because I don't win a lot but it's still refreshing and exhilarating when you kill the last person, and you can ride that high for the rest of the play session with your friends.

That's the other point, this game is WAY more fun with friends, especially good friends. Finding all the attachments to tweak a gun to your preference, moving through the map as a group, calling out flanks and positions, it's a nice feel to it.

This game won't be for everyone. Some people can't look past the bad and it's fine. Some people are more suited for the faster playstyles of Fortnite or H1Z1 and that's fine, but for me, PUBG is great.",1530974612,1530974612,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

It's a good game. The gameplay, the balance, and the movement are all good, I think.
The firefights, especially when you're in the top 10, are intense, and as you get used to the maps and building layouts you can use a lot of flanking routes and so on, making it more tactical as you get better.

There are some issues though. The main problem is that they made it 1.0 too quickly. I played the test server for 20 hours or so before they upgraded it to 1.0, and I simply don't see enough issues fixed. The most important one, where the game crashed due to bad_module or something, was fixed, but another very important one, in my mind, was rubberbanding.

At the beginning of a round, there is a massive issue with rubberbanding (being teleported backwards every now and then), which is irritating and occasionally enraging, when you land next to someone and get teleported away from the weapon as you both go for it, leaving him to get it and kill you instantly , which is not something I'd see as acceptable outside of early access. It was bothersome then, intolerable now. 
They should have fixed this before launch, even if they were feeling deadline pressures. They've already sold hundreds of thousands of copies - there is no real reason to fear the game would flop just because they pushed back the date a few weeks, especially if they announced the reasons. Could even spin it as a ""We don't want to become a Mass Effect Andromeda"" thing.

But they went ahead, which is dumb.

Beyond that first part though, the game is good. Confusing at first, since you don't know where to loot and where to go, but as you learn (or look up) what the better places and strategies are, you'll find yourself getting better and more confident.

I'd also like to adress the possible misinterpretation caused by watching streamers before buying the game. When someone like Shroud, Forsen, DrDisrespect, etc. is playing, they'll routinely get 20+ kills. This might lead someone to believe the game is more action packed than it is, since you're not actually likely to see more than 15  people throughout a round.
The reason these people get that many more kills is that when they're streaming, people watch them, and try to get on their server and kill them, leading to them meeting far more other players than you would in an average match. 
The streamers are very good at the game, obviously, but the killcount gives a skewed impression of the game. Just something to keep in mind.

Despite the rubberbanding issue, which is the main negative, I recommend the game. It's good fun, especially when playing with friends, and the firefights are intense and leave you thirsty for more. Hope they fix the rubberbanding soon.

EDIT

Alrighty, since I reviewed this they've fixed the rubberbanding, so honestly I just recommend it flat out. It's especially fun if you play duo/squad mode with friends with discord/skype, but solo is fun too.

Get ready to be frustrated tho, like all shooters you will feel like there are hackers whenever you die, but its unlikely. 
The gameplay is pretty fast, so you can easily get some games in even if you dont have that much time to play.

My tip is to use headphones with high volume, so you can hear footsteps.
Might also be worth practising your aim if you are not used to pc shooters. No auto aim here.

Sehr gutes Spiel mit noch einigen Bugs,
ich habe dazu ne Lösung hier im Text

Das Spiel läuft für eine Early Acces sehr gut, Ich spiele seit ein paar Wochen nur auf den Test-Servern.
Die EU-Server haben das stärkste Rubberbanging, aber man kann ja einfach auf die NA-Server wechselt. 
Da das Spiel noch in Endwicklung ist, sind Bugs normal.
Mit den Sounds hat man nur Bugs, wenn man nen schlechen Soundchip hat. 
Wenn man den Ton über Grakikkarte mit HDMI-Kabel an einen AV-Receiver gibt hat man Gar keine Sound Bugs.
Nutzt man den Onboard-Sound oder eine Creative-Soundkarte, hört man die Fahrzeuge nicht, wenn die weiter weg sind.
Algemein werden auch dann, wenn sehr viele Geräusche gleichzeitig vorhanden sind, einige ausgblendet, wenn man halt nicht den Ton über die Grafikkarte oder eine ASUS Strix Soundkarte nutzt.
Ich habe es mit verschiedenen Soundkarten ausprobiert und da sind mir dann diese Kombinationen aufgefallen.

The game is running very well for an early acces, I've only been playing on the test servers for a few weeks now.
The EU servers have the strongest rubberbanging, but you can just switch to the NA server.
Since the game is still in development, bugs are normal.
The sounds are only bugs if you have a bad sound chip.
If one gives the sound over Grakikkarte with HDMI cable to an AV receiver one has no sound bugs.
If you use the onboard sound or a creative sound card, you will not hear the vehicles when they are farther away.
In general, even if there is a lot of noise at the same time, some will fade out if you do not use the sound on the video card or an ASUS Strix sound card.
I have tried it with different sound cards and then I noticed these combinations.",1512908633,1512908633,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True

There is strategy in the way you approach an enemy, you can't simply rush to them and spray and pray for the kill, every movement must be made with strategy (at least if you want to get to the final stages of the game). Furthermore, the survival mechanic adds a lot of replayability to the game, there is something so addictive about dropping from a parachute, looting for whatever weapon is available and...surviving. Getting the sweet chicken dinner is very rewarding in such a game. On the downside, there are some games where you'll die within the first 20 seconds of the game. Also, and this is what bothers me the most, are cheaters. Sadly, there are still ots of ways to cheat the game, resulting in frustrating deaths where a player jsut shoots you blindly through a wall.

Game is ok. Changed resolution to max and would not let me click anything. My mouse would leave the game even though I was in game. I then Spammed all my keys to see if it would fix it. One key changed the game to windowed mode and I was able to change the settings back. While I am typing this my friends are yelling at eachother because one is downed and the other is not pushing to help. I am here fixing a problem and drinking all the beers I can.

Nothing comes close to it's realism, it's intensity, it's competitiveness, it's versatility or it's satisfaction in the genre. 
There aren't many better feelings than a Chicken Dinner when it comes to competitive gaming and all this is the reason why a paid game shocked and dominated the gaming world, even overcoming F2P giants like Dota and LoL, to become one of the most played games of all time. You'd be daft to think it was all just hype. 

Now I just want to take a moment to address the entitled, toxic circlejerk that is currently tanking this incredible game's review rating. 

Firstly: Hackers. Personally I have experienced maybe 5 definite hackers in my 625 hours of playtime, yet I find a lot of people screaming 'ANOTHER CHINESE HACKER, WTF BLUEHOLE' almost everytime someone hits a nutty shot or outplays someone; whether that be streamers, twitch chat or friends. It's to the point where it's such an easy copout for a lot of people instead of just accepting that someone is better than you because of how stigmatised it is. Not saying that hackers don't exist, they exist in every competitive game, just that myself, and everyone I know, have not experienced nor seen much of it, if at all in the past 200 hours, during my total play and view time. While there is also an active update system to counteract new hacks pretty much every single day. 

Secondly: Optimisation. Just to preface, PUBG is one of the boldest undertakings in gaming right now: 100 people in one 16x16 (or now 4x4) map, complex looting system with hundreds of items, weapons and throwables with hundreds of loadout combinations, multiple different destructible vehicles and structures and an infinite number of gameplay scenarios that can playout. All of this packaged into a game that offers two different playmodes (TPP and FPP) and has multiple queues and maps. This is not an easy game to 'optimise'. To cover my bases Fortnite has roughly 8 years of development and could run on a Macbook, please stop comparing the two, they are different games. 
Personally, my game runs like an absolute dream and my computer is not some unreachable titan of a thing and I have friends who have much lower end specs than mine and say the same. 
Yes, sometimes I have clipped on things and die because of it, but it's far from regular and every single day and every single patch things are being improved. So to literally abuse the developers on EVERY social media outlet, on EVERY new update is a gross underappreciation for the work this game requires and just goes to show how little these people actually read of patch notes or the development roadmap PUBG have set out. 
For example: Patch Note #15 releases with a MASSIVE list of performance, gameplay and stability improvements and all these people can scream about is 'lol copying Fortnites battlepass, lol money-hungry, fix the game first', completely missing the fact that the team that does the games OPTIONAL cosmetics is completely separate from the team that is regularly improving the game. 
These are the same people that fill every PUBG related comments section with 'suing Fortnite for stealing the Battle Royale genre because you're jealous and your game is dying' and other much less coherent rants; because they can't read more than the clickbait headlines regarding the case because they are the lowest common denominator such headlines are made for. Protip: they are not suing out of jealousy, they are suing because they have a solid case for Epic literally stealing game game resources when they were working together. I personally don't give a shit if it goes through or not, but misinformation helps nobody. 

Just a quick-list of improvements I want to see, and will be on the developers backs about, so I don't get labelled too much of a PUBG-fanboy:
- Perfect optimisation 
- Rewarding ranked and progression system
- Decent map and gamemode selection
- Remove TPP: the game is best experienced in FPP and the split playerbase just makes everything even harder
- More support for the esports scene

Anyway, with the game being the best it's ever been by a huge margin, with a brand new map and brand new content, with a keen esports scene thats finally getting the official support it deserves, with the toxic part of the community loudly announcing their departure from the game AND with the game being on special for the first time ever, now is the perfect time to play! 
Whether you are returning or playing for the first time it's time to chase them Chicken Dinners again and push this game to even greater heights! 
I look forward to killing all of you xo",1529655710,1529655710,True,8,2,0.524616122245788574,0,True,False,False

       - This game needs some work on it's guns, many of the smgs are way to overpowered, and marksman rifles are too overpowered. QBU needs some of the most work on balance because it can one-shot anyone no matter what kind of armor they have. I got one-shotted by it and had a lvl. 3 helmet. it's crazy.
       - Audio needs some work because really if you are fighting someone, you can never hear their footsteps. I was fighting a guy in the woods very close to me, and as I was reloading, I didn't hear a thing and was met with a surprise party from the guy I was fighting.
       - now this part is just community. You will always get double teamed weather you like it or not. You will get cleaned up weather you like or not. And there will always be someone that's better than you and you just have to persevere until you build up the mental capacity or muscle memory to do certain things pros do.

Now, if you are going to get this game, play with friends because it lightens the mood.

Obviously with 800+ hours into the game the answer is yes, but that yes comes with a lot - and I mean a LOT - of caveats.

As a shooter this game is - to me - the best one out there. It's more realistic that the others without going super dark and over the top like Escape From Tarkov. But it has issues. Lots and lots of issues.

For starters, it's never really been finished. The patches put out are maddening and for every one thing that gets fixed it seems there's another that it breaks. The last patch, for instance, overhauled the loot tables on one of the maps, but completely messed up the way that sound carries. 

I won't go into the cheaters because every shooter game has them and it's always a race between those writing exploits and those devs trying to patch them. But it seems as of this writing that cheating has become more prevalent lately. Maybe the devs will catch back up and maybe they won't.

PUBG is a great game but it's also an infuriating game that even the best players absolutely hate at times. It's like being in a toxic relationship that you know is toxic but there's just nobody better out there right now.

So Steam, is that good enough? Will you leave me the hell alone now about writing a review? PS. Your new interface sucks and I hate it.",1573167243,1573167243,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

So PUBG is my absolute favorite game, and I like it better than both Fortnite and Apex Legends.  PUBG is basically an accessible military simulator.  Here are the main reasons I love PUBG, and the things I think they need to work on: 

PROS:
Graphics are gorgeous 
Gunplay is very very satisfying and difficult
Driving is accurate and fun
4 maps
Takes lot of skill to master
In game community is not toxic (still somewhat, but not bad like CSGO)
Good party game
Movement is accurate and fun
The whole game just feel buttery smooth
Tactical gameplay

CONS
There still are hackers (not that many but a few)
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO WIN (frankly this is a pro as well)
Need to have a reasonably beefy PC to enjoy 
4 maps can make wait times kinda long (or random selection now)
Erangel is the most played map, so it can be hard to play other maps at times
There are bugs, but Bluehole does a very good job at fixing them

Overall: I would absolutely, 100% recommend this game to any and all BR players as the most realistic and intense battle royale currently on the market (except for simulators like Arma III).  It is completely worth the $30 dollars.

Some would say that this game is simulating realistic experiences. Yes, they got the guns right on point...

I don't ever have to play with a team to get the ""full""/""real"" experience. I can play solo queue against 98 other people and never have to talk to them or know anything about them beyond maybe that I've killed them or (more likely) they've killed me. Once I'm dead, I just hop back into the queue for another game. I'm not good at shooting or aiming really, and I will almost always run away when some random dude starts shooting at me first and I don't really know where they are. I treat the game as hide-and-seek a lot of the time, and that honestly isn't the worst tactic. There's all sorts of different play styles that end up being somewhat viable, so you don't HAVE to have perfect aim just to feel like you've done well.

I have been around for much of the good, bad, and ugly experiences that have occurred during the development cycle... and trust me... some of it was really bad. I have been waiting to post my review until the game was fully established, I was confident in my knowledge as a player, and was happy with what the direction the developers were going. 

So let me first start off what the game offers as far as play modes. There are two basic modes of play: Third Person Perspective (TPP) and First Person Perspective (FPP). The game originally started solely as a TPP shooter; however, they added the FPP camera mode in late beta. Each camera perspective offers 3 different max team sizes: Solo (1 person), duos (1-2), and squads (1-4). There are 4 maps all with unique sizes, buildings, and geography, and each map has a potential to have weather alterations to occur during the game (normal, rain/fog, sunset, night). Not all of these weather modes can occur on each map. For example, night mode only occurs on one map (it also has a day version). 

Throughout my entire time on PUBG I have played all the different modes on all the different maps in both camera perspectives. I mainly prefer FPP over TPP, and play duos and squads over playing solo. I despise playing TPP because you can just abuse the third person camera and look over edges without exposing your body... just feels kinda lame and unfair when people do this trick to you. It's less tactical and more camera abuse IMO. So I prefer playing FPP, and I will mainly only play duos or squads with my friends (I never play with randies). I don't play solo because it just feels too stressful and high stakes to the point where it is not fun for me. Plus, in most games, I have more fun playing with my pals anyway. One of my friends adores solo FPP though, it just isn't for me. I adore this game, because I only play the game modes / perspectives that I enjoy: FPP Duo, FPP Squads.

NOTE: There are statistics that say that TPP is a more popular mode than FPP. This doesn't mean that FPP servers are dead, not even close. But you will be more likely to see and recognize a name in the kill feed in FPP than in TPP since there are fewer players playing in it. 

NOTE: I have heard through the grape vine that there are a lot more cheaters in TPP than in FPP... but a lot. I have no evidence of this rather than personal experience. In all my time playing FPP, there has only been one instance where a dude was definitely cheating, and one time where I wasn't too sure (I've hit some pretty crazy shots through blind spots so I'm gonna give the person the benefit of the doubt). So in FPP, after hundreds of hours, only one cheater... seems like good odds to me. But apparently the mods work better in TPP or something like that and people claim there are a lot more cheaters in TPP. Like I said, this is all speculation and I have no proof, but it makes a little bit of sense since there is a bigger player pool. 

Anyway, moving on from that, lets talk about guns. The game has a bunch of guns and different types. Several ARs, SRs, SMGs, DMRs, shotguns, pistols, etc. 

1. I hate shotguns and melee items are useless (except the pan, the pan blocks bullets)
2. all the other guns are more or less well balanced, unique, and can be used in many scenarios (with a few exceptions like the G36C being a SCAR with more kick.
3. Basically, there are a lot of guns. I'm not going to go into much detail

One last thing I want to talk about is pacing. PUBG isn't necessarily slower or faster in pace when compared to APEX of Fortnite. I would say that on average, APEX and Fortnite games go way quicker and are way more aggressive in combat pacing. PUBG can be like this too; however, it doesn't have to be. I really like PUBG because the arenas are big enough to where I can either choose to have a hot drop or a chill drop. It all depends on how I feel and I get to mix it up a bunch. The larger maps allow for more variety in pacing. Sure you can get some pretty slow and boring games where nothing happens sometimes, but if you just drop hot or *lukewarm* that shouldn't be a problem. Basically, you can choose your own pacing based on where you drop, which I find pretty nice, especially compared to a game like APEX where you are basically always a click away from another team. 


Anyway, this review has basically been more of an explanation of the game and how it is setup so I hope it was helpful. I love this game, but only because I play in the specific modes that I enjoy. If you enjoy FPP and prefer playing with friends and want to have some shenanigans, I think you could justify at least trying PUBG out. Hope to see you on the battlefield :)",1559869768,1559869768,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The gun mechanics are the best i have seen in any game and make it feel really realistic and tactical although you can mess around and do stupid challenges if that's what you're into. 

I don't like how they made the vikendi loot prominantly smg's because it's such an open map and it would really benefit from taking lvl. 3 helmets out of world loot and increasing sniper spawn rate.

Sanhok is the best map in my opinion as it is only 4x4 km and as a result, has really fast paced gameplay in the early and mid game and has an exiting, close quarters end game.

duos and squads is also a really good experience if you cue up with your friends.

PUB was my first BR, like many of you people out there, it hit a spot and got us hungry for more BR. Since then we've seen a spike in BR growth and its started a wave so we've seen games like Fortnite, Spellbreak, BF5 and now Apex Legends; There are more BR titles that are on the way too so stay tuned. I still think that PUBG has a unique feel and will always have place in my BR heart. I played with my friends and i never had a blast like i did on PUBG, it built a foreground for my stream. For a while i stopped playing PUBG and i felt a disconnect and kind o flost about what games to play competitively. I just got back most recently to the community and I've been loving the lean shots, weapon skins, china and just all the gritty plays people make in PUBG (cough ""shroud"" lol).  Since the The update is looking beautiful, no doubt the UI settings will take some time to get used to, but overall the smg/pistol attatchments idea was cool and makes a faster loot system along with some other cool quirks here and there; Such as the M16 being able to hold its own at range now (range increase M16). The UMP takes 45Ammo now, which is cool I guess, it caught me off guard but because the UMP (now UMP45) is such a strong smg along with the vector, it now has a good regulation point to compare weapons (UMP45 Has Only 25 in Starting Clip)....but..uuhh....oooo vector i love u so much haha :steamfacepalm...anyway.. they added a stock to the M16 and it says it reduces sway and kickback along with something else (I Forgot check patch notes :) ).

This game is NOT similar to Apex Legends or Fortnite. Sure, they are all Battle Royale games. But this game offers a completely different gameplay experience. Do NOT buy this game thinking it will be similar to either of these games. It isn't. 

Most of the players that are still playing pubg are veteran players that have been playing since release or for at least a year. These people have 1000-5000 hours in this game. Most of the casual playerbase has moved on. Most new players that buy the game, get frustrated and move on too. This creates a deep learning curve as a result since most players are really good at the game. If you want to stand a chance then you need to invest many, many hours into this game. Only then will you see improvement. You need to play the training mode and learn all the guns, vehicles and attachments. Even when you do all this, you will still die a lot. What I'm saying is, this game requires a considerable amount of your time in order for you to win most of your engagements with other players. If your only going to be playing this game for 5 hours a week then I would recommend you NOT to buy this game. If your going to be playing every day for at least 3 hours, then, sure, give this game a shot. 
I'm not sure how this can be resolved. Maybe the devs can implement a competitive mode similar to rocket league. 

Moving on to the community. Playing with randos will be hit or miss. You will encounter people who don't have a mic or do, but don't talk for some reason. You will encounter quite a lot of toxic players. These toxic scum will curse you for dying or for letting them die. Even though they engaged the enemy alone. You will encounter people who queue for squad but, instead of dropping as a team, will drop solo half-way across the map from where you and your two other teammates landed. You will encounter a duo that ques for squad but, instead of dropping as a team, will land half-way across the map from where you and your other teammate landed. You will encounter team killers. You will encounter people who love to down you. Revive you. And then down you again. You will encounter players that take all the good loot and leave you with a pistol and a crowbar. This can't be avoided if you solo queue. Just keep this in mind.

Optimization is ok for the most part. I have a GTX 1070, a Ryzen 5 1600 OC to 3.8 ghz and I have 8gb of 1465 mhz ram. I played on the max settings and here's what I encountered: Loot sometimes doesn't spawn until two secs after you land. Textures can look ugly. Draw distance is an issue as buildings look awful from far away. Your fps will drop randomly. It depends on the map and the servers. I can play a game where it's buttery smooth but the next game I play can be a stutter fest. PUBG is a game of inconsistency. 
On a side note: when I go inside smoke, generated from smoke grenades, my fps always gets cut in half for some reason. 

If you can tolerate all this and can invest a serious amount of your time then by all means buy this game. This game is fun... When your getting kills and have decent teammates. It offers something no other battle royale can. A realistic combat experience.",1552371244,1552371244,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Took me long enough to learn how to shoot properly since i wasnt really playing shooting games before PUBG. Yet after 1k hours i still enjoy the game especially while im playing squad or duo with friends. The only thing im worried about is that the amount of cheaters is too damn high. Being crouch behind a rock and getting headshoted from 1km away by an iron sight m24 along with my duo was the worst experience i had in this game. Yet even after that im still playing and i enjoy meeting people who share the same passion. Only downside is playing in EU and playing squads with random people sometimes gets frustrating especially when you are forced to play with 2 arabs who are just speaking elfish and they dont even care about the rest of us.,1551311988,1551311988,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Actually, I strongly, strongly advise to play with friends or friendly people you find and in vocal. 
(but if you don't have lot of friend into these kind of game like me just join a gaming community there is a ton. I'm in TAW and everyone is super duper nice there :3 )

I'm recommending it if you love some tension and strong learning curve (learning to handle distances with scopes, spray...different with each weapon, different if modded or not...)(it's cute because after a while people will have their preference on different weapon, when usually in shooter people just all take the same gun all the time because it's the strongest, here there is other thing to consider like yes maybe it's strong but can you control it well too stuff like that), but arn't a rager/flamer. don't play the game if you rage easily it's probably not for you. 

the games makes you work on long term strategies (when you have time, planning your route, when you track someone., making trap..) but also short term (when you are blocked in a building, and a team is rushing you, when you need to run for your life to get in the zone but there are fight everywhere...), reaction time, staying calm when situation all of a 
 sudden is going wild it's really nice ! Got a lot of jumpscare moment, and lot of laughing out loud moment. 

there is still performance issue but I'm not too bothered by that, it's a lot better than in the beginning, only Vikendi seem a bit more taxing but it's still playable by a lot. (and Vikendi is my favorite map so) 
maybe people that downvote only play alone or are super competitive...idk...games run fine...I see a lot of pro player running the game fine too... I don't mean there is no performance issue problem but its not as bad as people are trying to tell you... (not anymore lol) 

the only thing I regret is the weather being disabled, I loved the constant weather there was in the beginning, now we have it a bit too but it's random and less powerful and not all the time. (I seriously loved the rainy map) I understand competitive were angry but still.... 
the biggest problem is cheater, it's a lot better than before but still...and the feeling reports doens't count... my team reported a whole 8 chinese players teaming together that we encountered (that was wild) and we didn't get the banning message...that's a bit discouraging...even more so that I don't report very often. 

also another small complaint, the mission...they are...really bad....I agree with Ibiza when he said on stream that with these kind of mission they make it looks like the dev arn't playing the game themself because 80% of them makes no sense and are no fun to do. I hope than for the new pass mission will be better, maybe then will I buy it... but not this time (too bad because some cosmetci are really, really nice looking, but I'm not grinding annoying as heck mission for a cosmetic with a pass that I paid for (when I paid for the game already lol).  but it's really a small complaint, at the end of the day, it's just cosmetic, and as cloth goes and weapon skins, you can take the one on your dead ennemies, so I just steal for the game cool stuff that I find lol.",1547977974,1547977974,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Do something to make this game worth buying and amazing again, so that more players will be interested to play the game.

You can be aggressive and make use of vehicles and smoke grenades for repositioning, flashbangs, grenades, and molotovs for assault. You can be a sniper, you can be a cavalier shotgun or smg CQB fighter. You have a variety of tools at your disposal.

As a simulacrum of battle royale, lulls in the action occur. Especially on the larger maps (there are 4 total so far, ranging from 16 km^2 to 64 km^2). This can cause an uneasy tension but also implores you to explore the huge sandbox on foot or in a vehicle. If you're bored you can go looking for fights at airdrop crates. You can search for rarer guns or you can find big jumps and do an informal rally race. Learning the map and how the terrain and buildings offer tactical opportunities is satisfying.

Quieter parts of the games (which last 0-33 minutes depending on which map as well as your personal luck/skill) are a great opportunity to goof around and chat with your buds. If you need to have a minute, just hide in a corner and have your buddies keep watch. It's half-hour outdoor airsoft games with your buddies on Discord, from the comfort of your home, and only a $30 one-time fee.

Flaws: The game is sometimes buggy, they have been slow but steady with fixes. Netcode now feels like in an acceptable place. Performance can be rough for lower-powered PCs. I recommend an Intel i3 or AMD Ryzen 3 CPU at a minimum, 8 or more GB of RAM, and at least 2GB of VRAM on a decently powerful GPU from the last few years. The game has ~weekly downtime of 2% that usually occurs on Tuesday night in the Americas, especially impacting CT/ET (UTC-6/-5) time zones. There is a lot of cosmetic loot crate type stuff but it's just cosmetics. Every game everyone gets access to the same guns and equipment. I am happy that people more wasteful with their money than me are allowed to fund new maps for me, I hope they can afford it.       

My recommendation: If you have an ok PC, know someone who plays it, and are remotely interested, try it out. Ask people who already play to teach you basics. Try some solo rounds.  Make dumb strategy plans with your team and attempt them ingame. Try doing motorcycle backflips. Set up a roadblock. Shoot at people up close. Shoot at them far away. Explore. Crazy stuff will happen and often you will die. Have fun chasing the Chicken Dinner!",1546683893,1549607853,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pros: Has amazing in-game graphics. Customization is a welcome addition in this game. Matchmaking is fast. Very low latency in medium internet settings in some regions and the ability to form squads even with less than 4 people is a welcome addition and feels like going up against some intense firefight. Has diverse maps and is very refreshing to play in TPP or FPP and each view mode has dedicated servers which would make sure no one has an advantagein a game like this.

Cons: Needs some tweaking in the hitbox and hit indicator such as displaying crosshairs when your bullets hit the other player and also needs stable aim controls as it kinda throws off balance at some instances. Needs few improvements in categories such as regional matchmaking as it usually matches with people from countries who don't have the same language and hence is difficult when trying to play in 4 man squad with strangers. Is almost unplayable in Solo as the loot placement on the map is not efficiently randomized and needs improvements. 

But the cons is probably being fixed as we speak as they did improve the plane drop and parachute gliding mechanics and has improved in stability in the last couple days.

Would give this a 7/10. Hoping to see what's next in this game!",1546570912,1546570912,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You just have to get used to doing a lot of progress then suddenly dying, sometimes in an unfair way, thats why its always better to play with a team, friends or randoms, to laugh at your mysery. yet very rewarding at other times. the open world concept make it feel endless, you can almost never encounter people in the same situation.  the design just hits the rights spot, and gameplay feel very realistic at times.

is it a good game, Yes, definately, especially recently it started feeling solid, not perfect, but good enough, comparing to all other titles, this is a worth it game. I look back at all the good times I have had with the game, thats why it deserves a recommend.

the fact that this game started with a simplistic team, with limited resources and could beat AAA title games in sales was amazing, I was always supportive of PUBG devs back in the days. 

BUT, after getting the huge success, and endless bag of shiny gold, they should have revolutionized the game, they could have added so much to it, they could have made it 500% better than it is, and could have kept their 1# spot, but I believe their own greed failed them. comparing to something like fortnite where they keep adding content, keep their fans hooked and game runs solid from start, PUBG makes you feel let down, very slow development, and huge hiccups at times with updates and bugs. I feel sad only because it could have been better. 

but overall, I love this game, playing FPP definately made it my cs go replacement, very addictive game.",1543297407,1543297407,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Packed up and ready to roll
Drive to a god building, out by the highway,
A place where nobody goes

The sound of gunfire, off in the distance,
We're getting used to it now
Died in El Pozo, died in San Martin,
We've died all over this town

This ain't no Minecraft, this ain't no Fortnite,
We're only fooling around
It's time for drinking, and shootin' dummies,
We got some time for that now

Hop in the Bronco, rotate real slowly,
Hope for a circle that's kind
I got three first aids, a couple of mollies,
We don't what we might find

High on a hillside, those guys reloading,
Let's get ready to roll
We work in the daytime, we drink up on Thriday,
Beer with delicious foam

This ain't no Minecraft, this ain't no Fortnite,
This ain't no fooling around
This ain't no Quake Live, or Super Meat Boy,
We got no time for that now

Rotate to prison? Or up to Mili?
Rotate to El Azahar?
You oughta know not to stand by the window
Somebody see you up there

I got some boosters, I got a med kit,
Get us back on our feet
But I ain't got no ammo, ain't got no gas tanks,
Ain't got no optics to see

Why play the slow edge? Why crash in central?
Gonna be different this time
Can't find a target, can't hear no footsteps,
Time for a vodka shot now

Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock,
We blasted right through the crowd
We got good armor, fuck you Mr Sparkles,
You know that that ain't allowed

Skin up like students, skin up like housewives,
I like a suit and a tie
I changed my gun skins, so many times now,
I don't know what they look like!

It's time for murder, never surrender,
We make a pretty good team
Don't get too sober, I'll do some driving,
You ought to get you a drink

Dropped all my flashbangs, what good are flashbangs?
They won't help me survive
Vodka shot burning, burns like a furnace,
The burning keeps me alive",1543140174,1571215725,True,1,2,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Finding a game is somewhat fast but encountering your first battle or finding your fist loot takes time do to waiting till everybody joins and waiting till you parachute down.
 The game is full of microtransactions but thankfully the game is not play-to-win, you can only buy cosmetics and cases. The game has a problem with cheaters especially in the Asian region.
 Inconclusion I recommend this game and the developers are actively fixing bugs. I personally haven’t encountered any game braking bugs...",1542997323,1561775050,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS - the Battle Royale game that took the Steam charts by storm. From the Early Access up to the 1.0 release in 2017 and until now, PUBG Corp. has been hard at work in developing the game; bringing in new contents and improvements. However, almost every update brings about bugs and errors, along with the occasional invasion of cheaters.

The game is straightforward, drop on the map and be the last player standing. The learning curve is quite steep but upon every match, you will grasp the essence of how PUBG is played.",1542908633,1557593402,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Most negative reviews comes from people who drop on school and cant handle the heat. This game goes deeper then just shooting everyone you see. You have to be patient, pick your fights, do rotations to get the environmental advantage, i have been in many situations aiming at my opponents head but deciding to not fire because of my position being bad. The game is even better with friends, however since the game has gotten forgotten, i suggest not playing the squad game-mode. you will only hear chinese words and you will just want to kill everyone in your team. Its just like playing solo, but while being able to hear some chinese dudes wanting to get revived in the background.

One of the best games i have every played (Duo with friends). 9/10        (solo 7/10) (Squad 4/10)

+ Very decent graphics.
+ Every game is different.
+ Alot of costumization.
+ Adrenaline pumping action.

- C h i n g  c h o n g
- Servers can have low player counts at night
- the crate system could use a change.

With all this said, should you buy it? If you have a friend who also is interested, then YES.

Great idea.
Game is fun.Specialy when u are playing with friends.

-
Bullet registration!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! makes this game most random fps game i ever played.
Some cheaters here and there can be annoying.
Bugs are managable.
BULLET REGISTRATION aka NETCODE aka TICKRATE = SHIT!!

I will say that i recomend it because of fun only. If you want to buy it for its competitive part - better wait for them to fix server issues with bullet reg.You can basicly fight somebody than run behind the wall and die there because of bullet reg.
I will play it for a lil bit more and will def. change to not recommend. if nothing happens before i quit it.

PUBG is a name that is very common among the gamers today. I bought this game a while back when its popularity was on rise. The gameplay is fine and the graphics are amazing.

Although, the dust has now settled and plenty of people play this game today. There is a lot that can be done in PUBG (neglecting the bugs, that the creators are working hard to fix). It has been my very first Battle Royale game and the gameplay impresses me. Although, I am not a big fan of the genre, but the game definitely has a lot of potential.

I rarely play FPS games so this was a good way for me to ease into it.
From my experiance I would say it is much more fun to play with friends, 
that way it's not always about the CHICKEN DINNER but about the fun moments this game has to offer. 
I personally have not seen many ""hackers"" in the game but my friends always seem to find one in every game.
For me, the best part of this game is the new custom matches.
A group of 10 friends playing cars only normal matches is hilarious and war mode vss is super fun with a .3 circle. 

Here are the negitives (in my opinion)

It can be a running simulator at times,
Getting popped in the head as soon as you get an awesome load-out (without even firing one bullet.)
The in-game loby chat is a full on autism fest.
Everyone is better than me (AKA ""HACKERS"")


Anyway long story short, I recomend trying this game if you havnt yet, 
but find some folks to play it with (shouldnt be hard)

I reccomend this game to anyone who wants to have a great time in PUBG. If you are debating wether to buy pubg or have bought it but you don't like it because ""you're bad"" then get better lol, You need to atleast play 100 hours on this game to be decent in my opinion. If you're just starting off I'd reccomend that you play a few solo games practice looting quickly and testing guns you like and fit your playstyle, then play some squads make friends and enjoy yourself. If you don't fancy playing squads just stick to going solos and blasting Russian hardbass in the aeroplane Omegalul. I've noticed that alot of people say there's too many hackers in pubg and people shoot through walls, It's buIlshit I've never expericed anything like this people are probably getting high ping and lagging which causes them to stay in one place for a certain amount of time until your ping is reduced. I've spent quite a bit of money on this game especially on shroud Skins and keys, I reccomend you just buy the skins of the community market and the keys as well much cheaper. Anyway so my overall opinion on this game is that i't's extremely fun and a great game overall.

It fits nicely into the simulation/survival niche, it ticks my boxes between fast arcade gameplay and brutal simulation......and manages this very well. Short fast games, with barely time to think.....at the very least it's teaching me some good map reading skills.

Too add some context i'm a long suffering DayZ fan that got tired of waiting. I uninstalled that game recently after 6-7(?) years of waiting patiently for a release. PUBG fits the gap perfectly, spookyily almost, i still pinch myself to remind me that its an Unreal engine port of DayZ, which is a standalone version of a Mod, that ran on ArmA2, which is a renamed release of the classic Operation Flashpoint.

My only request would be more vehicles, a light chopper would be nice. Hell lets just try teams, 50v50, limited vehicles, with 2 Team zones to be captured. Wouldnt take much effort and would match its rivals for more content.

Overall the sound of this game stands out above all else, the time delay on distant sniper fire, the delay of Thunder after a lightning bolt, I would give it 10/10 for sound quality.

But overall it needs work on various things, stability, graphics quality, and just a bit more content please!

Overall 7/10 (needs some work but has great potential)

The game itself is resources hungry but still Recommended if you have a PC with good hardware!!",1535633801,1535633801,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

why am i not able to see my inventory in 4:3 and 5:4 aspect ratio resolutions. it makes me very sad, that you guys dont seem to care about players that prefer to play on these resolutions.

As a game that wants to be an esports title, i think this should be at high priority.

This discussion also came up just after release, but no result. (it even got worse after the latest patch)

​Only way to play pubg on these resolutions is by setting your desktop resolution to a 5:4 or 4:3 aspect ratio and running the game in windowed borderless. I would like to see those resolution in exclusive fullscreen.",1535617721,1535617721,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False
